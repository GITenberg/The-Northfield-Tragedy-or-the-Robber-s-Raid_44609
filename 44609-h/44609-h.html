        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between the 23rd
        of August and the 5th of September a company of strangers made their
        appearance at different localities in the State of Minnesota
        attracting attention by their peculiar bearing, remarkable physique,
        and decidedly southern phraseology. They would appear sometimes in
        pairs, and at other times there would be as many as four or five in
        company. At one time they would be cattle dealers from Texas, and
        again they were gentlemen in search of unimproved lands for
        speculative purposes, and then again they were a party of engineers
        and surveyors prospecting for a new railroad when they would make
        enquires about roads, swamps, lakes and timber lands, carefully
        consulting maps they had with them (published at 66 Lake Street,
        Chicago, 1876), and when opportunity offered Andreas' State Atlas of
        Minnesota. These men visited St. Paul, Minneapolis, St. Peter, Red
        Wing, St. James, Madelia, Garden City, Lake Crystal, Mankato,
        Janesville, Cordova, Millersburg, Waterville, and Northfield, putting
        up at the best hotels, spending their money freely, and creating a
        general impression of free handed liberality. But there was a certain
        air of audacity blended with their <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sangfroid</span></em>
        and easy manners which led men to think they were no ordinary persons
        and aroused speculations as to their true character and vocation. The
        registers of the hotels honored by these guests bear the names of
        King, Ward, Huddleston, &amp;c., generally written in one line, but
        subsequent developments prove these to be merely <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nommes de
        guerre.</span></em></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Saturday, Sept.
        3rd and Sunday five of these strangers were in Mankato, and attracted
        universal attention by their peculiar carriage, suave manners, and
        fine, almost <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">distingue</span></em> appearance. They were
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span> well dressed and
        rode good horses, and sat their horses like men who were bred to the
        saddle. They made several purchases in the town, and one of them
        visited the City Bank and obtained change for a fifty dollar bill.
        When riding through the streets they showed their excellent
        horsemanship with a great amount of display and swagger entering into
        conversation with several citizens upon the merits of the animals
        they rode. They did not all stay at the same hotel, two of them
        registering at the well known and justly celebrated Clifton House
        while two others stopped at the Gates House, but it is not known
        where the fifth man put up. Two of the men, however, spent most of
        the night on the Sunday at a low brothel kept by the notorious
        character Jack O'Niel. This foul den of infamy is just outside the
        city limits on the opposite bank of the Minnesota river, and is
        surrounded by heavy timber. A more fitting place for a thieves'
        rendezvous, and for hatching plots or dark deeds, could hardly be
        imagined. It should be stated here, that after the visit of the two
        strangers, Jack O'Neil went to the Sheriff of Mankato and informed
        him that three young men—living in Mankato were plotting at his house
        to rob and probably murder an old man supposed to be possessed of
        considerable wealth, and residing at Vernon, some eighteen miles from
        Mankato. He made arrangements for the sheriff to overhear their
        conversation which resulted in the arrest of three young rowdies,
        Mark Ingals, George Peabody and James Quane, who were frequenters of
        O'Neil's infamous den.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 144%">A MURDER PLANNED.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears that an
        old man named Gallager, living in a log cabin on the skirts of the
        woods surrounding Vernon, was supposed to have in his possession a
        considerable sum of money. The old gentleman lived alone, was known
        for his parsimony, and thought to be <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        penurious niggard of his wealth.”</span> The plan of these young
        villians was to go to the house of the supposed miser, disguised,
        pretend to be <span class="tei tei-q">“lost chicken hunters in the
        woods,”</span> and induce the old man to come out and show the way.
        Getting him into the woods they were to extort from him by threats
        the whereabouts of his supposed hidden treasure, if threats failed,
        they were to have recourse to torture, and that failing to
        murder!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O'Neil accompanied
        these scoundrels reaching the house of Gallagher about 2 o'clock.
        They enticed the old man out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a la programme,</span></em> one placing himself
        on each side of him the two others bringing up the rear. After
        getting some little distance from the house, and as they were passing
        a shed the one walking behind with O'Neil raised his fist armed with
        brass <span class="tei tei-q">“knuckle dusters,”</span> and was about
        to deal the old man a stunning blow on the head, when he was seized
        by the Sheriff, who was lying in ambush within the shed. The three
        were conveyed to Mankato jail and locked up, and subsequently
        committed for trial upon the evidence of Jack O'Neil and the Sheriff.
        There are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span> those who
        think the whale affair was a <span class="tei tei-q">“put up
        job”</span> by the notorious Jack to get rid of the three men who
        were in his way, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to the
        five strange men in Mankato, they are next seen on the streets on
        Monday morning when a young man, Chas. Robinson who was acquainted
        with the notorious Jesse James, went up to one of them and remarked,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“How do you do, Jesse, what brings you up
        this way.”</span> When the man addressed eyeing the speaker keenly
        from head to foot, replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I guess you have
        mistaken your man”</span> and vaulting into the saddle, galloped
        away. With this incident, the five men who had attracted so much
        notice, excited so much admiration, and aroused many vague
        suspicions, disappeared from Mankato. The same day five similarly
        dressed, similarly mounted, and similarly appearing, strangers,
        arrived in Janesville, a village, on the Winona &amp; St. Peter
        railroad, in Waseca county, about 18 miles from Mankato. As at
        Mankato they stopped at different hotels, two slaying at the Johnson
        house, and two at the Farmers' Home. No one know where the fifth
        slept, but on leaving the village on the Tuesday morning they halted
        some little distance out, and one, taking off his duster, rode back
        toward the village waving it over his head; he was followed in the
        maneuver by another when all four rode away. It is thought this was a
        signal for the fifth man, who, it is supposed, stopped at some house
        in the neighborhood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those, who stopped
        at the Johnson house, never made their appearance at the public table
        until all of the rest of the boarders had finished their meals, and
        during their stay in the town declined to admit a chambermaid to
        their room to arrange it. After their departure several packs of
        playing cards were found in their room torn up and thrown on the
        floor, and several handful of buttons of various sizes were scattered
        about, showing that the inmates had been indulging in a protracted
        game of <span class="tei tei-q">“poker.”</span> The girls who waited
        on them at table, say they were quiet and polite, and never made any
        trouble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cordova is the
        next place these <span class="tei tei-q">“gay cavaliers”</span> turn
        up, all five of them staying at the same hotel, three occupying one
        room, and two another with a commercial traveler, W. W. Barlow, of
        Delavan, Wis., who describes them as polite, jocose fellows. They
        talked considerably of cattle, and from their language and peculiar
        dialect, Mr. Barlow thought them to be cattle dealers from the south.
        They left the hotel at 7 o'clock in the morning, politely raising
        their hats as they rode off. Cordova is about eighteen miles, almost
        directly north from Janesville.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next night,
        Wednesday, saw these five men housed at Millersburg, about
        twenty-four miles west and north of Cordova, in Rice county. They
        left here at an early hour on Tuesday morning, and at <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span> about 10 o'clock appeared in
        the streets of Northfield, which lies about eleven miles north-west
        of the latter village.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the same
        Wednesday evening, four men who answered the description of some of
        the bandits stopped at a hotel in Cannon City. The landlord thinks
        they were Bob Younger, Bill Chadwell, and the two men who finally
        escaped. He says that the next morning, the 7th, while three of the
        men were at breakfast, one retired to his room and remained a long
        time with the door locked. After all had departed, the chambermaid
        discovered a bloody shirt and a portion of a pair of drawers, one leg
        of the latter being torn off and carried away. The drawers were
        soiled with blood and matter, such as would come from an old inflamed
        gun wound, and it was evident that the wearer had such a wound on one
        of his legs. This is considered evidence that the man arrested in
        Missouri, in October, and supposed to have been one of the James
        brothers, was really him, but the alibi proved by that party appears
        to be sufficient to prove that it was not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen by
        the foregoing that there were originally nine men engaged in the
        plot, which gives plausibility to the opinion held by many that the
        terrible tragedy which followed was the result of a plan conceived by
        some Minnesota desperadoes, who engaged these desperate southern
        cut-throats to assist in it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">is a thriving,
        pretty, little village, situated pleasantly upon both banks of the
        Cannon river just thirty-nine miles from St. Paul, in Rice county, on
        the St. Paul and Milwaukee railroad. A neat iron bridge unites the
        northwest and the southeast sides of the town, and just above the
        bridge is one of the finest mill races in the State, the water in its
        incessant flow roaring like the ocean and appearing like a minature
        Niagara. There is a large flouring mill on either side of the river
        belonging to Messrs. Ames &amp; Co. The public buildings are not
        surpassed in the State for their beauty of design and adaptability of
        construction, and the Carlton college is another institution of which
        the town may well be proud. Placed as it is in the center of a rich
        farming district, the citizens are considered well-to-do, and the
        bank transacts a large business.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The five strangers
        appeared on the streets at an early hour of the morning of September
        7th, and attracted a great deal of notice from the citizens, some of
        them recognizing two of the men as a party who visited the village
        about a week before, stopping at the Dampier House.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At about 11
        o'clock two of these horsemen drew up at Jeft's restaurant on the
        northeast side of the river and asked for dinner. Jeft told them he
        had nothing ready, but could cook them some eggs and ham. The men
        told him to do so, ordering four eggs each. Their horses were left
        standing untied at the back of the premises. After <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span> ordering their dinner the two
        men went out into the street and after some time returned, when they
        were joined by three others and all sat down to their meal. They
        entered into familiar discourse with the proprietor of the house, and
        asked him what was the prospect of the forthcoming Presidential
        election. Jeft's reply was that he took no interest in politics, when
        one of the men offered to bet him $1,000 that the State would go
        Democratic. They still chatted on and seemed to be waiting for some
        one. At length they left and mounted their horses which were a
        sorrel, a cream color with silver tail and mane, a black, a bay, and
        a brown, all fine animals, sleek and clean limbed, and showing
        indications of blood. After leaving the restaurant, the five horsemen
        crossed over the bridge, two remaining in bridge square and the other
        three, riding up to Division street dismounted, and tied their horses
        to the posts at the side of the Scriver block. They then sauntered up
        toward bridge square, and after talking for some few moments leaning
        against a dry goods box in front of Lee &amp; Hitchcock's store
        (Scriver block,) they walked back toward the bank which they entered.
        Three other horsemen then came upon the scene and commenced at once
        to ride up and down the street in dashing style, and calling upon the
        citizens who from their doors were watching the eccentric proceeding,
        to get back into their houses, commenced firing pistols in the air
        with immense rapidity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Greater confusion
        could not be imagined than now ensued. Wherever persons were seen
        upon the street, a horseman would dash up to them in full speed, and
        pointing a long barrelled glittering pistol at their heads order them
        to <span class="tei tei-q">“get in you G—d—s—of a b.”</span> The
        streets were cleared in a few moments and stores were closed in
        quicker time than it takes to tell it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though taken
        at a disadvantage, when many of the men were out at work or away
        chicken hunting, the scare of the Northfield boys was but momentary.
        Collecting their perturbed thoughts men rushed about in search of
        fire arms, but this most necessary desideratum for a successful
        encounter with a body of desperadoes or madmen, armed to the teeth,
        was found to be very scarce on</p>

        however, succeeded in getting a shot gun with which he blazed away at
        the marauding scoundrels, or escaped lunatics, for it was not at

        with a breech loading rifle, came coolly upon the field of action,
        backed by Mr. L. Stacey and Mr. Phillips, while Dr. Wheeler armed
        himself with an old breech loading carbine and placing himself in a
        room (No. 8) in the third story of the Dampier House, delivered two
        very effective shots.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was now at its
        height, and firing was raging in downright earnest.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg 8]</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manning, from the
        front of the Scriver block, Bates from the clothing store of Mr.
        Hanauer, and Wheeler from the window directly over the clothing
        store, and unobserved by the daring scoundrels, made it lively for
        the desperate gang, and kept them from passing into Mill Square.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the gang
        was about mounting his horse and while stooping over the pommel of
        his saddle with his back toward Wheeler, that gentleman took
        deliberate aim and fired.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fellow pitched
        right over his horse falling on his head to the earth where he lay
        gasping for a few moments and soon was everlastingly still.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manning in the
        meantime was not idle, and while Wheeler was searching for another
        cartridge, he advanced from his retreat and seeing a horseman riding
        towards him up Division street, he took a steady deliberate aim and
        fired. The man immediately turned his horse and started off a few
        paces rapidly, but the horse steadied his pace, the man rocked to and
        fro, and suddenly the horse stopped and the man fell over to the
        ground, when another horseman galloped up, sprang from his horse,
        turned the fallen man over and took from him his pistols and belt,
        then springing again to his saddle, he rode up the street.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another scoundrel
        alighted from his horse and getting behind it commenced a rapid fire
        down the street, seeing which the intrepid and cool Manning, with all
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nonchalance</span></em> in the world, raised his
        unerring rifle and stretched the living barricade lifeless at the
        bandit's feet. The enraged brigand then ran towards Manning, fearless
        of the formidable weapon of Bates, and sheltering himself behind some
        packing cases under the open stairway of Scriver block, he commenced
        a rapid fusilade, evidently with the intention of keeping Manning
        from firing up the street at others of the gang.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Wheeler had
        succeeded in finding another cartridge and returning to the room from
        which he delivered his first shot, a young lady, who had remained at
        the window coolly watching the fight throughout, pointed out to
        Wheeler the man who was keeping Manning from effectual work.</p>

        Wheeler fired.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instantly the
        villain dropped his hand upon his thigh, and the girl cried out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, you aimed too low,”</span> thinking the
        shot had taken effect in the middle third of the right thigh.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wheeler at once
        left the room in search of another cartridge which unluckily he was
        unable to find. The wounded man who had changed his pistol to the
        left hand and discharged several shots at Manning, now turned about,
        and seeing Bates inside his store with a pistol in his hand and
        thinking it was from this source he had received his <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span> wound, as quick as a lightning
        flash sent a deadly missive at the unsuspecting Bates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ball crashed
        through the intervening glass of the store front, and burnt a
        scorching track across the victims face from ear to nose.</p>

        before the raiders commenced their wild career on the streets, three

        answering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The baffled man
        again turned to Heywood, and with oaths and threats endeavored to
        make him open the safe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heywood replied
        that he could not, when the scoundrel fired a pistol close to his
        ear, and said <span class="tei tei-q">“if he did not at once open the
        safe he would scatter his brains.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brave Heywood
        still insisted upon his inability to comply.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ruffian then
        seized him by the collar and dragging him toward the safe drew out a
        long, keen edged knife, and posing it over Heywood's throat,
        threatened to cut it from ear to ear if he did not at once open the
        safe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the brave man,

        feelings, that when he rushed upon the door to close it, his strength
        was unequal to the task, and before he could recover himself to renew
        the effort, a powerful hand seized him by the throat, and threw him
        back from the vault, at the same time a ruthless arm struck him to
        the ground with the butt end of a pistol.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking advantage
        of this struggle between Heywood and the robbers, Bunker sprang to

        reached the door a sharp report and the crashing of a ball showed him
        that he had only miraculously escaped from having his brains

        madly down Water street, not however till another shot from the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the street the
        baffled and retreating murderers sought their horses and vaulting
        into their saddles they were soon rushing with frantic haste out of
        town westward.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was some few
        moments before the citizens could sufficiently recover themselves to
        take in thoroughly the entire situation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There lay in the
        open street a few paces from the bank entrance a bandit in all the
        hideous ghastliness of a bloody death. A few feet from him was
        stretched the lifeless body of a noble horse, while further down the
        street on the opposite side another grim corpse lay in a pool of
        seething gore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Windows in all
        directions were shattered, and door posts showed scars of imbedded
        bullets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reluctantly the
        assembled citizens approached the bank, and the sight which there met
        their horror stricken gaze caused a thrill of indignation to seize
        upon every nerve; and strong men turned pale as they clinched their
        fists and set their teeth, registering an inward oath to wreak
        vengeance upon the miscreant perpetrators of the dastardly
        outrage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There lay poor
        Heywood! the man who dared death and defied three of the most
        notorious scoundrels who ever <span class="tei tei-q">“cracked a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some overcome with
        indignation, impetuously prepared for the chase, but others, perhaps
        more determined men, who were willing to follow on to the very death,
        were not so hasty in their departure, but as time proved were
        prepared to pertinaciously follow up the trial with the tenacity of
        the bloodhound.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two of the former,
        Davis and Hayes, immediately sought for horses and none being so
        ready as those of the two dead robbers, seized them, sprang into the
        saddles, and were soon in hot pursuit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both men were well
        armed with rifles—one an eighteen shot Winchester with globe sight.
        At every point they heard of the retreating villians upon whom they
        were gaining rapidly. Dashing through Dundas, Hayes and Davis kept up
        the pursuit till at last they saw a group of horsemen surrounding a
        wagon from which they were apparently taking the horses. As the
        pursuers advanced one of the horsemen turned from the wagon, and
        advancing a few steps up the road ordered the pursuing men to
        halt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Davis and Hayes
        instinctively obeyed, and strange to relate, these two men who had
        been so impatient to commence the pursuit, now that they were
        confronted by the audacious scoundrels found their courage waning,
        and they halted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did they again
        find their courage return, but they sat there and saw the marauders
        after securing one of the farmer's horses again boldly dash away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the robbers
        had gone, Davis and Hayes leisurely wended their way to Millersburg
        where they awaited the coming of the other pursuers, two men standing
        but little chance against six such desperadoes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true that
        Davis and Hayes had the advantage of the bandits in arms, but it is
        doubtful after all, if there are many men to be found who would have
        done differently, confronted as they were by six stalwart fierce
        knights of the road well armed and unscrupulous in shedding human
        blood, as they had shown at Northfield.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
        departure of Davis and Hayes, about thirty citizens organized into a
        pursuing party, some mounted on horses, others were carried in wagons
        and buggies, and all set out in full speed along the road the robbers
        had taken.</p>

        Had this gentleman been at his post, the people of Dundas would have
        been prepared to receive the bandits on their arrival.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        expressed as a wonder by many that the gang, before making the raid,
        did not cut the telegraph wires, but it appears from the confession
        of one of them, that their plan was a much better one. They intended
        to have destroyed the telegraph instruments before leaving, only the
        unexpectedly hot attack which was made upon them by the plucky boys
        of Northfield, completely demoralized them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first

          at once led by the sheriff to an empty store where were lying the
          inanimate and ghastly forms of the two bandits who had been shot
          down by the intrepid Northfield citizens. One was found to be six
          feet four and a half inches in height; his body exhibited a
          splendid physical development, with arms and limbs of thewy muscles
          and skin as fair and soft as a lady's; his face was of rather an
          elongated oval with sharply cut features; high cheek bones, well
          arched brow and deep-set blue eyes. His hair was a very dark,
          reddish auburn, inclined to curl. He wore no hair on his face, but
          was closely shaved, and did not appear to be more than 23 or 25
          years of age. He was clothed in a new suit of black clothes, worth
          about $25 or $30, a new colored shirt and good boots. The ball
          which brought him down entered about three inches, in a line with
          the left nipple and toward the center of the chest and completely
          riddling the man, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
          13]</span> passed out on the same side beneath the shoulder blade.
          On his person was found the card of the Nicollet House livery
          stable, St. Peter, on which is printed the distances of the
          principal cities in this part of the State. He had also on him an
          advertisement of Hall's safes cut from a local paper. His pockets
          were well filled with cartridges, and he had round his waist,
          beneath his coat, a cartridge belt. There has been some dispute as
          to the identity of the man, but it is now pretty well settled that
          he is Bill Chadwell <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          employment, and if she wanted money he would send her some. He also
          wrote in his letter that he would shortly be up this way, and would
          call on her. This sister was adopted by a minister residing at

          handkerchief round his neck. On his feet were striped half hose and

          ugly, jagged bullet hole, very large, and with the edges much torn,
          toward the center of the chest and about four inches below the
          heart. There were also several small shot wounds on the body of
          this one and three on the forehead; his hat was also riddled with
          shot, and it was evident that he had been hit twice from a shot

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The empty store
          in which the two corpses lay, is on Mill Square, which is
          immediately over on the south side of the handsome iron bridge
          which spans the Cannon river just below the mill race. On the north
          side of the square is the flouring mill of Ames &amp; Co. On the
          west is Scriver's block and two or three small stores, among them
          that in which the bodies lay. On the east side is the office of the
          Rice County <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Journal</span></em> and a wagon shop, and on
          the south is the Dampier House, under which are three stores, the
          last eastward and just opposite the corner of the Scriver block, is
          the clothing store of Mr. Hanauer. The Scriver block has also a
          frontage of 80 feet on Division street, 22 feet of which is
          occupied by the First National Bank of Northfield, in which one of
          the saddest and most daring tragedies was perpetrated—the heartless
          and deliberate murder of a faithful and brave man in the defense of
          the valuable property under his charge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some
          four or five wooden buildings below the bank on Fourth street, and
          it was in this narrow space, from Mill Square to Fourth street,
          that the great fight which startled the whole country took place.
          Many indications of the fearful contest in bullet holes were found
          in every direction. Windows were pierced and shattered and balls
          must have been thrown around for a time as thick as hail, for the
          whole encounter took place within the short space of fifteen
          minutes. The conflict was a sharp and bloody one, and speaks
          volumes for the coolness and intrepidity of the citizens of the
          little provincial town.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Mr. Bates,
          who took a prominent part in the encounter, the following was
          learned:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He said at about
          11 o'clock his attention was called to four men who came from over
          the river. They came over the bridge and were mounted on four
          splendid horses. The men were well dressed, and Mr. Bates says,
          four nobler looking fellows he never saw; but there was a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reckless,
          bold swagger</span></em> about them that seemed to indicate that
          they would be rough and dangerous fellows to handle. Altogether he
          did not like the looks of them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, at about
          2 o'clock in the afternoon, as he was standing at the entrance of
          the store, talking to Mr. C. C. Waldo, commercial traveler from
          Council Bluffs, he saw the same men ride past—three came up
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span> the street from
          mill square and one down, street meeting within thirty feet of the
          bank. They dismounted and tied their horses to the hitching posts
          and two, he thought, went into the bank and two came down to the
          staircase leading up into the upper stories of Lee &amp;
          Hitchcock's buildings, and here they stood leaning against the
          banisters talking. Commenting upon their fine physique, and upon
          their unusually good mounts, Mr. Bates and Mr. Waldo withdrew to
          the far end of the store to look over some sample trusses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not
          long been so occupied when they heard several shots fired in rapid
          succession, and the thought flashed upon the mind of Bates at once,
          that the bank was in danger—Mr. Waldo stating that he cried
          out:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Those men are going for the town, they mean to rob the
          bank.”</span> Mr. Bates, however, does not recollect saying
          anything, he became so excited. He remembers, though, rushing to
          the door, and seeing some men riding up from the bank—they came
          riding towards him with long pistols in their hands and called out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Get in there you son of a b——.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Bates at
          once seized a shotgun and ran back to the door, but the gun would
          not go off. He then put down the gun and seized a fine seven
          shooter which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">not</span></em> loaded, and as the men came
          down again, (they were riding to and fro, evidently intent upon
          keeping people from going towards the bank), he standing behind the
          door jambs, called out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now, I've got you.”</span> And pointed the empty
          pistol as if drawing a bead on them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They turned
          their horses suddenly and fired at Mr. Bates, the ball crashing
          through the plate glass. There were other men at the bank firing
          down the street. The next he saw was Mr. J. S. Allen running down
          the street from the bank, and two shots were fired at him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Manning, of
          Mill Square, whose store is adjoining the block in which the bank
          is, next came upon the scene. He ran out of his store with a breech
          loading repeating rifle, and took a deliberate aim and fired from
          the corner, Mr. Bates calling out:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jump back now, or they'll get you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next Mr. J. B.
          Hide came up with a double-barrelled shot gun and discharged the
          two barrels, and retired to re-load. Mr. Phillips also took a turn
          at the scoundrels, and L. Stacy delivered a cool, deliberate aim.
          Mr. Bates next heard a report over his head and saw one of the
          desperadoes fall from his horse. The horse made a faltering plunge
          forward and then suddenly stopped and the man pitched over with his
          face to the ground and in a few moments was dead. This shot was
          fired by Henry Wheeler from an old carbine from out one of the
          windows of the Dampier House.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Manning was
          still firing, and as he crept to the corner Mr. Waldo called
          out:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Take good aim before you fire.”</span> Immediately
          after this shot one of the horses started up the street and the
          rider began to reel and swing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page16">[pg 16]</span> to and fro and suddenly fell to the ground
          just opposite Eldridge's store. Another horseman immediately rode
          up, dismounted, and spoke to the prostrate man, who was stretched
          out at full length, supporting himself on his outstretched arms,
          when he rolled over on his back. Then the other man took from him
          his cartridge belt and two pistols, and, remounting his horse, rode
          off.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          horseman, finding Mr. Manning's fire too hot, dismounted from his
          horse and got on the opposite side of it for protection, when an
          unerring ball from the breech loader brought the horse down, the
          man running behind some boxes which were piled beneath the
          stair-case before mentioned, and now ensued a</p>

          fellow and Manning, the scoundrel keeping himself well under cover,
          but a ball from Wheeler's musket struck the fellow in the leg, half
          way above the knee.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He at once
          changed his pistol to the left hand and grasped the wounded limb
          with the right, still trying to get at Manning. Finding himself
          getting weak, he turned and limped off up the street, but, seeing
          Bates with a pistol in his hand, he sent a ball whizzing toward
          that gentleman, grazing the side of his cheek and the bridge of his
          nose, and burying itself in a collar-box in the store.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Bates says
          he feels the ring of that ball in his ear still, and the ball, he
          says, he will ever keep as a souvenir of the hottest day Northfield
          ever saw.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man limped
          away, and when he got opposite to Mr. Morris' store, he cried out

          teller of the bank, stated that he, in company with Mr. Heywood and
          A. E. Bunker, were in the bank at about 2 o'clock, when three well
          dressed, powerful looking men entered by the door, which was open.
          They held large revolvers in their hands, and one of them cried
          out: <span class="tei tei-q">“Throw up your hands, for we intend to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They then asked
          which was the cashier, to which Mr. Heywood replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is not in.”</span> They then sprang over the
          counter and demanded the safe to be opened. Addressing each in turn
          they said: <span class="tei tei-q">“You are the cashier,”</span>
          which each denied.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing Heywood
          seated at the cashier's desk, one of the ruffians went up to him
          with his long, narrow-barrelled pistol and said:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You are the cashier; now open the safe, you —— —— son

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          One of the men then went into the vault, the door being open.
          Heywood at once sprang forward and closed the door of the vault,
          shutting the robber in, when another of the men seized Heywood by
          the collar and dragged him away from the door and released the
          incarcerated robber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man who came
          out of the vault—a slim, dark complexioned man, with a black
          moustache, then called to the others to seize the silver which was
          lying loose (about $15) and put it in the sack. They did not do
          this, but seized about twelve dollars in scrip and put it into a
          two bushel flour sack which they had with them. The dark
          complexioned man, who appeared to be the leader, then again
          attacked Heywood, insisting upon his opening the safe, threatening
          to cut his throat, if he did not, and actually drawing a big knife
          across his throat.</p>

          struck him with a pistol and knocked him down, and, dragging him to

          stolidly refused, when the villain shot at him, but did not hit
          him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Evidently the
          shot was intended rather to intimidate him than injure, but the
          scoundrel had reckoned without his host, for the effect was lost
          upon Heywood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But upon the
          discharge of the pistol Bunker made a start for the back door and
          ran for dear life, one of the robbers pursuing and firing, the shot
          taking effect in the shoulder. Bunker, however, reached the street
          (Water street) and ran to Dr. Coombs' office.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the whole
          of this time four or five men were riding up and down the street,

          the bank then sprang over the counter and rushed to the door, and
          Heywood staggered to the chair, but, as the last one <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span> was getting over the
          counter, with one hand on the cashier's desk, he turned round and
          deliberately fired. Heywood fell senseless to the floor! The man
          then sprang on the rail and out at the front door, and he (Wilcox)
          cleared out of the back door into Manning's hardware store.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wilcox was not
          sure whether the ruffian struck Heywood when the latter staggered
          to the cashier's chair, and he did not stop to see if he was dead
          when he fell. He said the reason he did not try to get out or help
          Heywood was that one of the men stood over him with a pistol in his
          hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Allen said
          he saw three men cross the bridge and go toward the bank. They were
          all big, powerful men, well dressed. One had sandy side-whiskers,
          shaved chin and blue eyes. Another, wore a black mustache, and was
          a slight but tall man, and better dressed than the others. The
          third man was heavy set, with curly brown hair, and beard of about
          one week's growth. They had tied their horses and talked a while,
          when another came up, and he went into the bank. Mr. Allen then
          waited half a minute, and then walked up to the bank to see what
          was up.</p>

          says that he was first attracted to the strangers by seeing the
          horses tied, and he went up to one and was examining the saddle,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Drawing a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appeared that
          the object of the men on the street was at first only to keep

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Poor Heywood was
          shot through the head, the ball entering at the right temple and
          passing downward and inward, scattering his brains all about, and
          doubtless depriving him instantaneously of consciousness, and
          putting him completely beyond all suffering, although he breathed
          for about twenty minutes, but did not speak. In addition to the
          bullet wound, there was a slight scratch in the right side of the
          neck as from a knife.</p><a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. E. E. Bunker
          was not considered dangerously wounded, the ball passing in at the
          back of the right shoulder, below the point of the shoulder,
          passing downward and forward and upward, coming out just above the
          clavicle, making only a severe flesh wound. This wound, however,
          was very nearly being a fatal one, as the ball passed close to a
          principal artery, which no doubt, had it been severed by the deadly
          missive, would have produced death by hemorrhage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
          capture at Madelia of the Younger boys, Mr. Bunker has given his
          recollections of the bank raid, and as it differs in several points
          from others already given, we embody it in this narrative. It will
          be seen that the narrative recognizes two of the men who entered
          the bank as Charley Pitts and Bob Younger.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Bunker said
          that himself, Mr. Heywood and Mr. Wilcox were sitting at their
          respective desks, when they heard a heavy rush from the bank door
          to the counter. They turned round and saw three men climbing over
          the counter and with their knees on it and revolvers pointed
          directly at the three bank officers. A man presumed to be Jesse
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span> James, and who
          acted as leader, called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Throw up your
          hands, we are going to rob the bank.”</span> James then ran across
          the room and passed Heywood into the vault, which was open, but
          seeing the safe door closed, turned back from the entrance and
          seizing Heywood by the collar who, from being older than the others
          and from the position of his desk, was naturally supposed to be the
          cashier, ordered him to open the safe, Mr. Heywood said it was a
          time lock, and it could not be opened. The other said that was a
          d—d lie.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Charley Pitts
          then came up on the other side of Heywood and threatened to kill
          him if he did not immediately open the safe. One of the others
          called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let's cut his throat and be
          done with it.”</span> Heywood commenced shouting murder and
          repeated the cry three or four times. They then hustled him about,
          and James struck him on the head with the butt end of his pistol,
          knocking him down. He was then dragged towards the vault, where he
          lay with his head partially in the vault. James then drew the knife
          across Heywood's neck, who did not say anything, appearing to be
          partially insensible, when another of them stooped down and fired
          close to the prostrate man's head, the ball penetrating a tin box
          containing papers in the vault.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this time I
          was on my knees on the floor, with Bob Younger standing guard over
          me. I had a revolver under the counter, where I stand, and which
          was in full view, and I endeavored gradually to edge over and
          obtain possession of it, but Bob saw the attempt, and seeing the
          weapon, put it into his pocket, saying, at the same time, that I
          could do nothing with this, and it was of no use. He then placed it
          in his pocket and commenced searching me, but did not take anything
          from me. The pistol was a Smith &amp; Wesson, and we always
          regarded it as an excellent weapon. Bob having turned his head
          partially around to see what was going on in the other part of the
          room, I raised my head with the view of giving the alarm to any one
          I saw in the street, but my movements were quickly observed by Bob
          who pulled me down, saying at the same time, that I had better keep
          quiet for, if I attempted to rise again he would kill me. He then
          inquired where was the cashier's till, and I pointed to a box
          containing some nickels and scrip, the former done up in
          cartridges. He seemed to know very well there was more loose money
          than that, and he told me he would kill me if I did not show him
          the till. I did not answer him, and he pulled out a drawer
          containing stationery, but the drawer having some $2,000 he did not
          open, supposing, probably, that in its contents were the same.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, while
          the two men were engaged with Heywood, James told Bob Younger to
          bring out the sack. Bob took out a green bag and thrust a handful
          of scrip into it, but did not take any of the nickels.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distance
          from where I was to the rear of the bank, is about 25 feet, and the
          rear door of the two hardware stores adjoin the rear door of the
          bank. I thought if I could make my way out in this direction,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span> I would have a
          chance of giving the alarm, so that the citizens would come to the
          rescue. In making this movement, I should have to pass where Mr.
          Wilcox was sitting, and I made a slight motion for him to move so
          that I could get past. He saw my motion and shifted his position.
          The man who stood over me having his attention directed to the
          proceedings of the others, I started, but was immediately followed
          by Charley Pitts, who fired at me, the ball going through the
          blinds of the door and lodging in a brick chimney, but not striking
          me. There was a stairway leading down, and Pitts standing on top of
          that, fired down on me, I having reached the bottom at the time,
          fired again, the ball just striking me below the scapula, passing
          through the thin portion of it, and down, passing out about half an
          inch below the collar bone, the course traversed being about seven
          inches, and narrowly missing the sub-claviel artery, where the
          wound would have been fatal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I think it was
          James that said, while keeping us down, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“don't one of you move; we have fifty men on the
          street, and you will be killed if you move.”</span> The safe was
          not locked at all, but there was only about $15,000 in it, which
          they might easily have secured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Bunker said
          he recognized the body killed at Madelia, as that of Charley Pitts,
          and also identified Bob Younger, by the likeness published
          herein.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several citizens
          of Northfield narrowly escaped with their lives during the
          encounter. A Norwegian, Nicholas Gustavson by name, was struck with
          a bullet at the right side of the head, just at the ear, the ball
          running under the scalp and out at the top of his head. He says
          when he was struck, and for several minutes after, his whole left
          side was paralyzed. But after a few minutes of unconsciousness, he
          was able to reach his boarding house, but the next day he was
          unable to rise from his bed. It was evident that the skull was
          fractured, and depressing upon the right lobe of the brain, and if
          the patient was not opportunely relieved by trepanning the skull,
          the man must succumb. Subsequent events proved the correctness of
          this view, for the operation was not performed, and the poor fellow
          expired on the eleventh—four days after the dreadful tragedy, thus
          adding another victim to rekindle the fire of indignation in men's
          minds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Illustrative of
          the dangerous nature of the weapons of the lawless ruffians
          carried, it should have been stated that balls fired from one side
          of Mill Square struck and completely riddled buildings on the other
          side of the square, a distance of one hundred and fifty yards.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Friday afternoon
          the coroner, Dr. Waugh, from Faribault, held an inquest upon the
          bodies of the two scoundrels who met with such a richly deserved
          end, and the following gentlemen were sworn as a jury: A. H.
          Rawson, S. L. Bushnell, R. Silk, J. L. McFee, R. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span> Plummer and C. W. Gross.
          The jury were not long in arriving at the following verdict:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That the two unknown men came to their
          deaths by the discharge of firearms in the hands of our citizens in
          self-defense and in protecting the property of the First National
          Bank of Northfield.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same jury,
          with the coroner, held an inquest over the remains of the lamented
          victim of the raid. The witnesses who gave evidence were E. Hobbs,
          ex policeman J. S. Allen, F. Wilcox and E. L. Fuller, whose
          statements were similar to those the same gentlemen made to the
          writer, and recorded elsewhere in these pages. The verdict found

            freebooters had dashed from Northfield with but five horses, one,
            the brown mare carrying double. They rushed ruthlessly on, taking
            the entire road, and demanding that those they met should
            <span class="tei tei-q">“take to the ditch.”</span> A short
            distance out of the city an old German farmer with his heavy team
            loaded with <span class="tei tei-q">“garden truck,”</span> met
            them on a narrow road on each side of which were deep gullies.
            Drawing his pistol the leader exclaimed with an oath,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“take the ditch G——d d——n you.”</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was made at
            full speed, causing the greatest excitement. All were now
            mounted, but a horse taken from a farrier, Empey, near
            Northfield, evidently found it difficult to keep pace with the
            trained nags belonging to the robbers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A short
            distance out of Dundas the gang stopped at a farm house and
            borrowed a pail which they took to a spring near by. Here they
            paused long enough to water their animals, and wash the desperate
            wound which Bob Younger, (as was afterwards found) had received
            directly through his right elbow, and which besides bleeding
            profusely had become almost unbearable, even to a man of his
            determination and vigor. Throwing the pail by the side of the
            road, the squad hastened on, little thinking of the pursuit which
            was being organized in the rear.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As it is now
            known that the squad, as it now remained, consisted of Cole, Jim
            and Bob Younger, Charlie Pitts, and probably the James boys,
            their names will be used in this narrative hereafter, wherever
            they are known from their own statements to have been.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the horse

            the landlord of Cushman's Hotel in Millersburg saw the other four
            pass his house on a gallop. He says that three of them stopped at
            his hostelry the night before. He saw the other two pass some
            time later, but did not recognize among the six, the man that
            made up four whom he had entertained.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Cushman

            appearing like a man who had never done any manual labor. His
            horse was cared for by the others, and his quiet directions were
            promptly obeyed. The men talked but little, saying that they were
            from Illinois and were civil engineers looking over the country,
            to decide upon the feasibility of building more railroads in that
            section. This party had left Cushman's house at 9 o'clock

            meantime there had been mounting in hot haste, and detachments in
            wagons and on horses had started from Northfield to undertake to
            head off the bandits on what is known as the Dodd road. This road
            the robbers seemed to have missed, and, notwithstanding their
            earlier start, they did not arrive at the town of Shieldsville,
            fifteen miles away, until after a squad of five men had reached
            that point. These men were in a saloon refreshing themselves and
            telling their wonderful tale, when the rough riding marauders
            dashed up in front of the place. The boys were attracted to the
            door by the noise of the horses' hoofs, and two or three started
            for the wagon in which their arms had been left. This movement
            was promptly checked by the leader, and the lads slouched back to
            the saloon.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bandits
            leisurely proceeded to water their animals, and while doing so an

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dash and
            daring of the robbers had electrified the people of the town so
            that nothing was done, but after they had got well off, the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span> gallant squad
            of pursuers started on the trail. Soon they were joined by
            others, augmenting the force to seventeen, and the bandit band
            was sighted in a ravine about four miles from Shieldsville. The
            attacking party opened fire from the brow of a hill but their
            arms consisted of rusty shot guns, and small pistols, hence
            nothing was accomplished. When the attack commenced the bandits
            wheeled in platoon and discharged a harmless volley at the
            pursuers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horse of
            one of the robbers fell, and it was supposed that he had been
            shot, but he quickly recovered. As the bandit sought to mount him
            again, he found his girth broken, and in obedience to an order
            from the chief, he mounted behind his comrade, and the gang moved
            off at a round trot. The abandoned horse was found to be the one
            taken from Empey, and the saddle, the one borrowed near
            Millersburgh.</p>

            BALKY NAG.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour or two
            later the bandits seem to have lost their road, for they called
            at the house of a farmer named Sager, and demanded a horse,
            saying they were after horse thieves. Sager is a prudent German,
            and required to see their authority. They laughed at him and
            secured his horse, but on attempting to mount him, they found him
            balky, and were obliged to abandon their plan. They then forced
            the farmer to accompany them quite a distance to point out the
            road, first asking the route to Waterville, but finally deciding
            to take the Cordova road. Sager went with them to the edge of the
            town of Kilkenny, and left them in a large meadow going towards
            Cordova.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this field
            the bandits resorted to all known means to destroy their tracks,
            and esconced themselves in the mysterious depths of the Big
            Woods, where it was impossible to track them, as the thousands of
            hogs which root up their living there, had almost entirely
            displaced the sod, and it was not an easy matter to distinguish
            the footprints of man or beast.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many have the
            impression that the bandits were sheltered Thursday night by a
            notorious character living in the woods on the west side of
            Kilkenny, but according to the statement of those captured, they
            lay hidden in the thickets.</p>

            THE PURSUIT GROWS HOT.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During
            Thursday night excited crowds had gathered in all of the towns in
            the vicinity that could be reached by telegraph. Men of every
            class volunteered to join in the hunt, and they came armed and
            mounted in every conceivable style. The great majority had arms
            of little account, and a large portion of the volunteers were
            entirely defenceless. There were many intrepid men who joined in
            the pursuit in an earnest manner, and many younger ones who
            started as they would in a chicken hunt, for sport and
            excitement.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The telegrams
            had summoned the chiefs of police, detectives and <span class=

            police forces of St. Paul and Minneapolis, and at six o'clock
            Thursday evening, Chief King, Detective Brissette, Sergeant
            Clarke and patrolman Brosseau and deputy sheriff Harrison, of the
            former city, and Chief Munger, Detective Hoy, and officers West,
            Hankinson, and Shepherd, of the latter place, were on the scene

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was thoroughly
            picketed during the night, probably two hundred volunteers being
            engaged. Early on Friday morning Sheriff Asa Barton, of Rice
            county, who had been up all night arranging the guards, commenced
            to accept new recruits and dispatch them as rapidly as possible
            to the front, providing every weapon that would snap a cap, that
            could be obtained in the vicinity. His labors were arduous and
            incessant, but his splendid constitution and indomitable
            perseverance enabled him to endure throughout the three weeks
            that the hunt continued. The number of robber hunters cannot have
            been less than five hundred during Friday.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pursuers
            dispatched from Faribault were headed by brave, intelligent men,
            among whom were Col. Williams, J. H. Harding, Dr. Hurd, T.
            Loyhed, Mr. Baxter, James Hunter and Sam Dunham, chief of police
            of this city.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing was
            heard of the bandits during Thursday night, but on Friday, it was
            found that they had started in a westerly direction. It was
            difficult to pick their trail, as men and horses shod in every
            manner had passed over the roads during the night and morning.
            Rumors of all sorts came in from all points, and the leaders
            scarcely knew what to do, but they wisely determined to maintain
            their line of pickets.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can truly
            be said that these knights of the road traveled on their
            reputation, and they were looked upon as such desperate and
            sanguinary foes that few men would have been willing to meet them
            except at considerable odds. The pickets had been liberally
            placed, but the squads were necessarily small, as an area of more
            than four miles square was guarded. At most places only two or
            three guards had been placed, and through one of these squads

            WONDERFUL ESCAPE</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was made. It
            was supposed that the bandits would try to break the line at a
            northerly point, toward Cordova, hence their track to the
            southwest was unlooked for.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At seven
            o'clock Friday morning two men called at the house of a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span> Mr. James, on
            the Cleveland road, and asked his wife, he being away, if she had
            seen anything of two little black mules that had strayed or been
            stolen. Being answered in the negative, they asked how far the
            river was behind the house, and if there were any swamps between.
            She told them the river was about one-quarter of a mile back, and
            that there was a swamp which she thought they could pass.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the men
            then inquired which direction was south. Mrs. James informed him,
            when he said he guessed she was mistaken, but on taking out a
            pocket compass, he acknowledged that she was correct, and made a
            polite apology for contradicting her. On leaving, they bade her a
            pleasant <span class="tei tei-q">“good morning.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gang then
            attempted to cross the Little Cannon river behind James' house
            but could not get through the swamp, and returning they took to
            the road going toward Waterville. After proceeding a short
            distance they accosted a party of five men working on the road.
            They said they were in pursuit of the robbers, and asked if the
            two bridges, one above and one below were guarded. When told they
            were they asked if there were any fords between. On learning that
            there were two, they said that they had better take care of them,
            and immediately started across the fields to the river.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner had
            the bandits left, than Mr. James, who had been told by his wife
            of the visit of the men, came up. After a hurried consultation,
            in which it was decided that the party that had just passed were
            the robbers, James with three of the men hastened to the upper
            bridge about a quarter of a mile away, and reported to Major
            Rogers, who with two men held that point. A portion of the squad
            immediately started for the fords, James and two others going to
            the lower, while Rogers and the remainder stopped at the upper
            one about forty rods away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The swamps and
            growth had retarded the progress of the bandits, but James had
            scarcely gained his position when the gang appeared on the
            opposite bank of the river leading their horses. They were
            carelessly talking, and made directly for the ford. Just as the
            leader stepped into the shallow stream, James exclaimed,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Come on boys,”</span></p>

            time discharging an ineffective charge of small shot at the front
            robber. At this the leader shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“This
            is too hot, boys, we must take to the woods,”</span> and all
            hastened back up the bank. But as they moved away, they must have
            heard the retreat of the pickets, who broke and ran, one leaving
            his time-honored Prussian musket in the brush, and another losing
            his valuable set of false teeth, for after moving up into the
            woods for a distance of not more than twenty rods, they wheeled
            and crossed the ford in the coolest and most deliberate manner.
            The alarm was immediately carried to Waterville, and the base of
            operations were soon changed. In the meantime the St. Paul party,
            with several active and intrepid <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page28">[pg 28]</span> Northfield men, had been actively on the
            trail, and just at dusk a sight of the enemy was obtained as they
            were breaking across a distant cornfield for the cover of the
            woods.</p>

            TRADING HORSES.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before
            this the bandits had visited the farm of Ludwig Rosseneau, in
            Elysian township, and impressed two horses. The farmhouse is
            entirely secluded from the road, being nearly half a mile back.
            When the gang arrived there with their five horses, two of them
            went to the barn, while four remained at a small bridge near by.
            Mr. Rosseneau and his son went to see what they wanted, when they
            asked if he had any horses. One said he was the Sheriff of Rice
            county, and that he must have two horses and a guide, for he was
            after horse thieves, showing a large document, which the boy
            Wilhelm, who had been to school, says was a map of Minnesota.
            When the old man objected, the rascals drew their pistols and
            quickly closed the bargain. Two horses were brought from the
            stable and saddled; one was mounted by one of the gang, and the
            Rosseneau boy was forced to accompany them on the other. The
            simple German peasants had heard nothing of the Northfield
            tragedy, and hence were not particularly frightened, although
            greatly annoyed. The cavalcade passed from the farm, the leader
            ordering the boy to guide them through the woods to the old state
            road. It was a difficult country to ride through, but the boy
            knew the road and traveled along, talking in boyish style and
            getting short answers, until the chief ordered him not to talk so
            loud. On arriving at an opening near the road, a halt was made,
            and the lad was placed upon one of the robbers' horses, which was
            disabled by a cruel gall caused by the girth under his forelegs.
            He was told to remain there until they returned, which would be
            soon. After waiting about half an hour, another lad came up and
            told him of the robber raid. Young Rosseneau quickly understood
            his position and made quick tracks for home. He says that after
            the robbers left him they dashed into the woods across the
            clearing, and galloped away as fast as possible. The next morning
            Rosseneau's horses were found in their pasture near the barn.</p>

            ANOTHER HORSE TRADE.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Subsequently
            it was discovered that during the night of Friday a horse had
            been taken from the pasture of John Laney, 1½ miles from the
            village of Elysian, and a handsome sorrel mare badly chest
            foundered placed in its stead for value received. This farmer
            made a good trade as did Rosseneau, for his own horse came home
            early Saturday morning.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hunted
            bandits were in a country from which it seemed impossible for
            them to escape, it being almost surrounded by lakes and swamps. A
            close guard was kept, and all expected that a capture would
            surely be effected on Saturday. There were hundreds of men
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span> on the hunt,
            but it is useless to say that the search was thorough, for if it
            had been they would have been found. Saturday passed and also
            Sunday, and no sign of them was discovered. Many became
            discouraged and weary, and as the weather had been wet and cold,
            large numbers of the pursuers returned to their homes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, the
            hunt was continued by many persistant men from all parts of the
            Stale. As their labor was unrewarded by any discoveries of
            importance until Monday and Tuesday, the symmetry of the
            narrative will be maintained by following the robbers according
            to their own statements.</p>

            SAFE FOR AWHILE.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to Friday
            night they had succeeded in procuring food from farm-houses, at
            one place going in and helping themselves to the entire cooking
            of the family. Wild plums and grapes had also contributed to
            their wants, and they had not suffered much, except Bob Younger
            whose wound was extremely painful. After trading horses at
            Laney's, Friday night, they rode to a point in the woods about
            three miles back of Elysian and a short distance from German
            Lake. Here, less than one hundred and fifty yards from the road,
            after turning loose the three borrowed horses, they tied their
            three remaining horses to trees, and made a rude shelter with
            their rubber blankets in which they passed the night cold and
            wretched.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saturday
            morning they broke camp, and after tying their blankets around
            themselves with their bridles, they abandoned their faithful
            steeds, and started forth on foot, leaving five saddles behind
            them. They moved slowly and cautiously, and during the forenoon
            they discovered a sort of island which proved an excellent hiding
            place. In the center of this little-explored tract, they found a
            pretty pond of water, and feeling secure they established a
            regular camp, making a good fire, and taking comfort generally.
            So safe did they feel that they shot a hog and a calf, but not
            succeeding in killing them the first time, although the shots
            went straight through their heads as they aver, and as the
            animals made good time in escaping, they lost a savory feast, not
            daring to fire more shots. During the most of the time the
            bandits had proceeded on foot leading their horses through the
            woods, and their feet had become terribly sore while their
            stockings were entirely worn out, and while resting here they

            not rest here too long as the corn fields and potato-patches on
            which they depended for subsistance were at an inconvenient
            distance, and their hunters might flush their camp at any moment.
            Saturday night they again took up their tedious march, and about
            daylight went into camp a mile from the German Catholic church in
            Marysburgh, the bell of which was plainly heard by the robbers
            when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span> it rung
            for early mass. They concluded not to attend church that day,
            contrary to the usual custom of Cole Younger at least, and a
            luxurious breakfast of roasted corn and baked potatoes was
            prepared. This camp was within a few rods of the edge of a
            clearing, showing the remarkable boldness of the gang. Here two
            small boys saw three of them walking just outside the woods, and
            reported it, but little faith was placed on their story, as the
            general impression was that the bandits were still in the woods
            behind Elysian or had made a break on their horses to the
            Minnesota river, and hence to parts unknown. Their camp of Friday
            night had not then been discovered; and it was supposed that they
            were still in possession of their horses.</p>

            nearly nine miles, to a point but about 2½ miles back of the city
            of Mankato, where, finding an empty house in the woods on the
            Kron farm they slept comfortably Monday and Tuesday nights.
            During the most of this time they had lived on fodder corn
            uncooked, hazel nuts, grapes and wild plums, but Tuesday morning

            AT JANESVILLE.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Saturday,
            Sept. 9th, a party consisting of A. A. Keller, Russell M. Church,
            F. Martin and W. Rhine started across the country from Northfieid
            to Faribault, and catching there the train, proceeded to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span> Owatonna,
            where they were joined by a party of some thirty well armed
            citizens.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Telegrams were
            sent to Waseca for a special train to carry them to Janesville.
            Finding a case of needle guns at Owatonna for Brisette, they took
            them on with them, arriving at Janesville at one o'clock. They
            found Brisette and his men there. They had been on the track of
            the gang from the first, often getting sight of them, and never
            for an hour losing their trail till Saturday, when they failed to
            see them during the whole day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the
            morning the party was divided into companies and took to the
            woods, determined to hunt the villains up. Besides the parties
            sent out in squads to the woods, other parties were out in each
            direction up the Winona and St. Peter R. R. on hand cars.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole
            country around Janesville was alive, and hundreds of volunteers
            were rushing about in search of arms to join the pursuers. By
            noon on Sunday there were at least three hundred men on the
            war-path, seeking for the fugitives and anxious to secure some
            portion of the reward offered for their capture.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The telegraph
            was kept in lively operation, and every rumor was sent from point
            to point, and mounted messengers carried the news along the lines
            of outposts, keeping the men well informed on the events of the
            day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At about 3
            o'clock a messenger came riding up to headquarters, his horse
            reeking and foaming, and the man's manner portending news of the
            utmost weight and importance. Hurrying in to the depot he handed
            the telegraph operator a paper containing the information that
            the fugitives broke cover near Elysian and were making for
            Waterville. To inquiries he answered that three of the robbers
            were seen and one was riding a cream-colored horse, and that the
            police were hard on their track.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Telegrams were
            at once sent to Eagle Lake, Owatonna, and other points, repeating
            the exciting tale and asking that the posts along the line
            between Waseca and Janesville be made especially strong—the
            supposition being that the thieves would try to cross somewhere
            between those two points. In prompt reply to these telegrams a
            special train was dispatched containing over one hundred men,
            well-armed, from Northfield, Winona, Rochester, Owatonna and
            Medford, and these were left in squads often between Waseca and
            Janesville, twenty-two of them coming up for instructions and
            news.</p>

            robber hunters had been amusing themselves by <span class=

            did no harm, and only stirred men to double diligence, and the

            FINDING THE HORSES.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monday night,
            a party, headed by Sheriff Dill and Brissette, and including the
            St. Paul police, and several determined men from Northfield,
            after a tedious hunt arrived at the house of John Dehn about a
            mile from the place where Brisette had lost the trail on Friday
            night.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The detective
            was in a quandary not understanding how the horses at least could
            have got through the line of pickets that had been maintained.
            One of these animals was of a dun color, or as the country people
            called it <span class="tei tei-q">“a yaller hoss,”</span> and
            would have been noticed among a cavalry regiment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mystery
            was soon to be solved however. A portion of the squad took refuge
            in Dehn's hay loft for the night, and at daylight Tuesday morning
            as Mr. Mills Church, of Northfield, an old war veteran, was
            peeping from his roost, he saw two hard looking horses, peering
            over the farm gate, evidently envying the inviting stack of oats
            within.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Church
            immediately went to them, and found they were two of the robbers'
            horses without doubt. One was a bright bay with white face and
            three white feet, and the other was a handsome brown mare. Both
            were very thin and showed marks of exposure, and deep rowelling
            on their sides. The brown had large galls each side of her back
            bone made by the saddle, and these were covered by thick scabs
            that had been forming at least three days. Both wore halters,
            that of the bay being without a strap, while a piece about a foot
            long hung to the halter of the brown, it having been chewed off
            by the wearer.</p>

            well cared for, and their trail was immediately taken up while
            their tracks were fresh, but the horses had stopped to graze so
            often thus doubling and changing their course, that it was almost
            a fruitless task. Feeling that Dehn's house at which they were

            LONG LINE OF SKIRMISHERS</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was formed,
            and a thorough search of the woods made. At about 7 o'clock the
            left of the line came upon the last camp where the robbers were
            in possession of their horses. Dr. Hurd of Faribault was in
            advance, and as he came to the spot, the noted buckskin horse
            whinned and stamped showing most unmistakable signs of delight at
            again seeing a human form. The camp was located so near the road
            that it is a wonder that it had not been discovered. At each of
            three saplings a horse had been tied, the yellow one in the
            middle. They had been given as long range as possible, but there
            was no feed for them except the bark and wood of the trees to
            which they were tied. These were eaten as high as the horses
            could reach and deep into the roots. The ground around was
            stamped hard, and there were evidences that the poor animals had
            made desperate efforts to escape. At a short distance away
            pronged stakes were found which showed that the fleeing men had
            found shelter in a most uncomfortable manner. They had probably
            thrown blankets over the frame and stopped to dress the wounded
            man. There was no trace of eating or sleeping. Behind a log near
            by, all the saddles of the five laid in a pile, an old
            russet-leather saddle, much defaced, at the bottom of the pile,
            very wet. This showed two shot marks, from one of which a
            medium-sized pistol bullet was taken. Two others on the pile were
            black, solid-seat saddles, one new, open, black McClellan, one
            new russet McClellan. The black McClellan was marked underneath,
            at the front, $8.50, with the cost mark above: two old blankets
            and three old gunny bags were found. The robbers carried away all
            the bridles and good blankets.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horses at
            Rosseneau's and Laney's were then procured and the entire five
            were delivered to Commissioner Scott of Rice county, it being the
            feeling that that community should have the benefit of what was
            recovered.</p>

            the opinion gained ground rapidly that the robbers had made
            tracks on foot and were many miles away. The hunt had virtually
            come to an end, was the thought of many, and a general movement
            was made by the pursuers toward those homes to which of late,
            they had become strangers. The St. Paul police had started for
            home, and the Minneapolis force was already there. The
            indefatigable and energetic sheriff of Winona, was even

            to accompany them on the road to pilot the way beyond Mankato.

            that about six o'clock on Wednesday morning the 13th, he started
            from his house in search of the cows. He had scarcely passed the
            barn going towards the woods when six men came upon him. They
            were for the most part powerfully built men, well dressed, with
            linen dusters and blankets strapped up in bridles. The men came
            up to him and said they were</p>

            was one of them. He protested that he was not, when one said they
            would take him with them anyhow, and proceeded to bind his hands
            behind him with a bridle rein. They then insisted, upon his
            showing them the way past Mankato, so that they might strike the
            Minnesota above, asking him questions as to whether they would be
            likely to find any boats upon the river, and if it was possible
            to ford or swim across. Dunning begged them to let him go, when

            THE NORTHFIELD ROBBERS,</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">but if he
            would show them the way and keep a silent tongue in his head they
            would send him a handsome present. He still begged to be
            released, stating that he had a delicate wife and young children,
            and if he should be away from the farm he would lose his
            situation, and then what would his family do during the winter?
            The robbers thought he seemed a good sort of a fellow, and if
            they could only trust him, perhaps they might let him return, but
            could they trust him? Dunning protested by all that was sacred
            that they might, and promised if they would only let him return
            home, he would not breathe to a living soul that he had seen
            there and he expressed a hope that they would get through safe
            and sound without being captured. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page35">[pg 35]</span> robbers held a short consultation
            among themselves, in which Dunning thought he heard proposals of
            shooting him on the spot. It was to him</p>

            MOMENT OF DREADFUL SUSPENSE,</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and he shook
            with very fear, but to his inexpressible relief one of the men
            said that they had agreed to let him return home—they did not
            want his family to suffer for them. They then asked him his name
            and postal address, which they carefully noted down, repeating
            their former promise of a handsome present if they got safely
            off, and if he kept his faith with them.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the men
            asked if they could not get to the river from where they were by
            leaving the timber and crossing the level open flat, and if they
            could not swim the river easily. To which Dunning replied that
            they would be discovered almost immediately if they attempted to
            leave the woods, advising them to keep under cover as much as
            they could. With this they released his arms and set him free,
            they the while seating themselves upon the ground and watching
            him till he got out of sight. He at once ran home, and after
            getting his breakfast, he crossed over from his house to the
            residence of Mr. Shaubut, and told him the whole story.</p>

            THOUSAND EAGER HUNTERS</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">crowded into
            the streets of Mankato seeking information and anxious for
            orders. The ubiquitous Dill was there with his disciplined men.
            Baxter was there and Sheriffs Finch, Davis, Barton, Long and
            Harrison, Mayor Wiswell and Captains Holmes and Owens. Thus were
            the counties of Winona, Blue Earth, Rice, Waseca, Faribault and
            Ramsey represented by their sheriffs and men. The five Northfield
            boys, who had never for an hour given up the hunt, were there and
            ready again to guard, mount and scour the woods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Davis, of
            Winnebago, whose story of the robbers' appearance the evening
            before at Indian Lake, was so little heeded, was now almost
            lionized, and it was surprising how many were all at once found
            who believed in the famous horse thief catcher from the
            first.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
            necessary that some system be pursued; accordingly General
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span> Pope, of
            Mankato, was appointed generalissimo of the forces, and that
            gentleman at once set about a plan of organization. Bridges must
            be guarded, cross-roads and by-paths watched, patrols sent out,
            and skirmish lines established. One would think by the measured
            tramp of armed men, the bustle, the eager excitement, the groups
            of mysterious gossips, that Mankato expected a seige from the
            combined forces of all the hostile savages paying allegiance to
            Sitting Bull, rather than that the men were called out to capture
            six fugitive robbers.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the people
            seemed determined. Their looks seemed to say that they were tired
            of playing this game of hide and seek, and were for once in
            downright earnest and bent upon bringing this thing to a quick
            and decisive close.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a
            miserably wet morning, the rain descending in a continuous
            shower, and the air was filled with a damp chilliness, which
            rendered out-door vocations particularly disagreeable. The
            streets and roads were filled with slimy mud—griming and
            sticking, to the intense misery of pedestrians. But the rain and
            the mud and the cold could not deter the excited populace, and
            even women caught the infectious fever of excitement and dared
            the elements in search of news. All the city was on the tip-toe
            of expectancy, but the hours glided slowly along and no news was
            brought in from the skirmish lines or outposts. Reports, it is
            true, were rife, and many a thrilling tale of manly courage and
            sanguinary encounter was whispered by mani-tongued rumor. At one
            time the robbers were all slaughtered, at another, a brave
            citizen was sacrificed, but enquiry proved them to owe their
            existence to fertile imaginations. Evening at last closed in upon
            a miserable day, and the tired, wet and hungry hunters began to
            return. The Clifton house was filled with them, the congenial
            host doing his best to appease their ravenous appetites, after
            which the weary men stretched themselves at length upon the
            floors of the parlors, offices and halls to snatch a few minutes'
            refreshing slumber. Meantime a strong guard was placed at every
            point around the city, and mounted men patrolled the streets all
            night.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At about
            midnight some of the men on guard heard peculiar whistles at
            different points, which seemed to be replied to, the call
            resembling the low note of the quail, and the answer, the high
            note of the same bird. Report was made of the circumstance at
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Headquarters,”</span> and while a
            discussion was progressing as to whether the men were not
            mistaken, and their ability to distinguish between the veritable
            bird call and its its imitation, a mounted messenger came dashing
            in with the news that three of the robbers had</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">over the Blue
            Earth river and had escaped toward South Bend. The news spread
            like a prairie fire, and in an incredibly short time the streets
            were alive with armed men hastening down toward the point at
            which the fugitives had broken the line of outposts. Sheriff
            Dill, who, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span>
            had retired but a few minutes to the well-deserved comfortable
            bed put at his disposal at the Clifton, was soon up and away with
            a posse of men. Other leaders were equally alert, but all
            mentally, and some physically, too, cursed the blundering guard,
            which had permitted itself to be caught napping. Enquiry soon
            ascertained the fact that</p>

            SOME ONE HAD BLUNDERED.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears
            that General Pope in arranging for the night guard had provided
            for a strong body of men being placed upon each of the bridges
            over the Blue Earth, this being considered the vulnerable point
            in the line, but a telegram coming to him stating that the
            railroad bridge would be specially guarded by the railroad
            officials, he removed his guard from that structure, and, as it
            proved, opened a direct way for the brigands' escape. The
            railroad authorities had placed two men and a boy on the bridge
            to guard it, and about two o'clock they saw three men approaching
            in single file. The guard stood on one side and the men advanced
            and walked deliberately on to the trestle work and passed over,
            the heroic guard being too much frightened to even breathe. As
            soon as the fugitives had got fairly past, the boy rushed down to
            the covered bridge and alarmed the guard there, who at once sent
            a mounted messenger into the city to tell the miserable tale.
            Nothing during the whole hunt had such a humiliating effect upon
            the people as this fiasco, but they were doomed ere long to
            receive as great a disappointment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The night was
            one of almost Egyptian darkness, and men could do little good
            tramping through muddy lanes and through dripping woods without a
            trail to guide them. The resolve, therefore, was to await the
            break of day, when at the earliest hour of dawn a close hunt and
            hot pursuit would commence. Accordingly with the gloaming, Hoy,
            of Minneapolis, with a number of Mankato men and others, started
            out and they were soon shown</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">which led
            across the railroad bridge along the Sioux City line into a melon
            patch, back to the road and on across the Garden City road. The
            engineer of an incoming train motioned the pursuers toward the
            thick woods covering the slopes of Pigeon Hill, some two hundred
            yards from the State road. But on went the chattering, noisy
            trail-hunters, chasing each other up the line. Quickly they came
            to a halt and found they had overrun the trail. Doubling upon
            their tracks they came back several yards and found the
            foot-prints turned off into the woods. Their attention was now
            attracted by a strong smell of burning feathers, and looking up
            toward the beautifully wooded acclivity, they saw a thin, pale
            column of smoke issuing from the luxurious foliage and spreading
            itself out like a hazy film.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point
            there seems to be conflicting statements as to what was done,
            some asserting that Hoy at once made a dash toward the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span> campfire;
            others say that he spent several minutes consulting and ordering
            his own men back to Garden City road to surround the camp. One
            man, Mr. Hansen, of Mankato, says that he actually saw one of the
            robbers and wanted to fire, but Hoy would not let him, stating
            that he might hit some of the pursuers instead of the pursued.
            Both Cole and Bob Younger afterward stated that Hoy did not
            charge into the camp at all. Be this as it may, the camp when
            entered was found to be deserted. When the writer entered the</p>

            ROBBER'S CAMP,</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">a bright,
            clear fire was burning, in front of which, toward the railroad, a
            long pole was wedged in between some saplings, over which had
            been hung the coats and blankets of the band. The front part of a
            shirt was found, stained with blood. One wristband was wanting,
            but that found at the camp discovered on the previous Sunday,
            exactly corresponded with it. The shirt was of good quality and
            had evidently never been laundried. Bob Younger afterwards told
            the writer that the garment belonged to him. A blood-stained
            handkerchief (new) with border torn from two sides was found,
            with a large blue weather-proof coat, a brown linen duster,
            nearly new, a piece of drugget about two yards square and two
            bridles. One of the bridles had a very severe Mexican bit, and
            was afterwards recognized by a Mankato man as being one that he
            had exchanged at St. Peter for a milder one. Near the fire were
            two fowls and a chicken skillfully dressed and jointed ready for
            broiling, and several cobs of corn, some of it partially roasted,
            and some of it showing marks of teeth, as though some of the men
            were too hungry to wait till breakfast was ready. At the back of
            the camp fire the hill ascended precipitously, and in the dead
            leaves were distinctly seen the trail of the disturbed bandits.
            Reaching the summit of Pigeon Hill, they crossed the Garden City
            road and entered the heavy timber and dense underbrush leading
            down to the Blue Earth river. The whole of this wood was filled
            with men, a party of about two hundred men forming a skirmish
            line about three paces apart and marching completely through it
            down to Jones' ford. It was now about mid-day, and it was thought
            the outlaws had doubled on their track and were concealed

            BEAUTIFUL MINNEOPA.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly
            toward this lovely spot were the forces concentrated, and all the
            afternoon the wide space fronting the Rev. D. T. Rowland's
            residence was filled with armed men. Although this delightful
            spot is well known to pleasure-seekers, it is doubtful if ever
            before it was the scene of so much bustle and animation, and the
            two beautiful daughters of the reverend gentleman were kept
            busily employed attending to the wants of their countless
            guests.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole
            neighborhood was thoroughly searched, the deep and shadowing
            glen, the rocky chasms, the towering heights were all
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span> searched
            through and through, not a thicket nor a cave, nor a gloomy
            recess in the tortuous course of the serpentine Minneinneopa
            escaped the ruthless tread of the pursuers. No one could form an
            adequate idea of the number of men engaged in the hunt if they
            remained themselves with one party or in one place. As the writer
            was taken from one point to another, along highways and by ways

            exertion, the writer was hailed by three men hastening across
            from heavy timber to the right of the Garden City road. Halting,
            he was told excitedly that the three men crossing from Garden
            City came upon a dense thicket overhanging the Blue Earth river
            where they heard voices. They stopped and listened when they

            they saw nothing. After some time they fired off their shot guns,
            but no response was made. For four hours the men kept guard over

            pursuers, heard the shots, and saw one at least of the party
            within easy pistol range of them. At nightfall many of the
            hunters returned to Mankato, but still more remained out all

            City, on the Watonwan river, a distance of at least thirteen
            miles. The line passed through the village of Lake Crystal, the

            ANOTHER ESCAPE.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears
            that at a crossing over a small creek on the outskirts of Lake
            Crystal, ten guards had been placed. Nine of them had procured
            hay and ensconced themselves in the bushes to enjoy a quiet
            sleep. A young man named Richard Roberts, of Mankato, alone was
            faithful to his trust, and while the others slept he kept his
            ceaseless vigil. The night was pitchy dark, but the brave boy had
            become accustomed to it, and his ear was rendered wonderfully
            acute. At about midnight he thought he heard the sound of horse's
            hoofs on the deep sand of the road, and he got a position where
            if any one passed he could read the outlines against the sky.
            Soon a horse appeared bearing two riders.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stepping from
            his bush he cried <span class="tei tei-q">“halt,”</span> when the
            two men slid over to the further side of the horse. Dick then
            raised his rifle, and as the bandits undertook to rush their
            horse past him, he fired. The animal gave a start, throwing his
            riders, and ran rapidly away.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two men
            must have been hit in the legs, but they were not disabled, for
            they immediately gained their feet and dashed into a cornfield
            near by, where their trail was lost until morning. In falling
            they made deep indentions in the sand, and one lost his hat,
            which was of fine make and nearly new. Before young Roberts had
            time to start in pursuit, the frightened horse again dashed by
            him in hot haste to his home about two miles back. Early in the
            morning of Friday a farmer named John Vincent came into town, and
            reported that one of his horses had been used by the robbers
            during the night.</p>

            BORROWING A HORSE.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All of the
            farmers in the vicinity had been warned to take the strictest
            care of their horses for fear that the robbers would appropriate
            them. In accordance with these suggestions Mr. Vincent had turned
            his horses into a concealed meadow, and locked his barn strongly,
            after removing all except his cart harness to the house. However,
            the cunning robbers found the animal, and breaking into the barn
            improvised a bridle with a halter and an old bit, cutting the
            long lines of the cart harness for reins, girth and stirrups. The
            next morning the poor old black horse, which bore an admirable
            reputation for honesty, was found meekly standing in the door
            yard evidently ashamed of the Tam O'Shanter ride in which he had
            assisted. He was dirty, and lame, and his sides bled from the
            wounds inflicted by the cruel spurs of the bandits.</p>

            been the guiding mark wherever the trail had been struck. At
            daylight the trail was found by the impatient hunters, and it was
            rapidly followed to the Seymour farm about four miles away across
            the fields. Here the fleeing villains had unceremoniously helped
            themselves to a splendid team of large gray mares, owned by Geo.
            Rockwood, who was engaged in haying on the farm. These animals
            were reputed to be the best in the county, and their subsequent
            achievements proved that their reputation was merited. The
            robbers had appropriated bridles, but finding no saddles they
            proceeded, riding bareback. It is supposed that they stole these
            horses at about three o'clock Friday morning, and it was nearly
            six o'clock before it became known, so that pursuit could be
            organized.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon news
            arrived by telegraph that the robbers had called at the house of
            a farmer named Jackson, two miles northwest of Madelia, at 6
            o'clock, and asked for something to eat. On being told that
            breakfast was not ready, and urged to dismount and wait for it,
            they said they did not want breakfast, only a loaf of bread. The
            good wife gave them what they asked for, and they insisted upon
            paying for it. Mrs. Jackson finally accepted ten cents.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
            visitors was hatless, and he asked if they could not provide him
            with an old one, as his had blown off into a swamp. Mrs. Jackson
            said that they had only a new one which she had bought for her
            son the day before. This the robber persuaded her to sell him for
            $1.50, and then both started off at a brisk pace.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At 1:30 p. m.,
            the fugitives called at the farm of Andrew Nelson, four miles
            directly west of Madelia, and asked a few questions in regard to
            the roads, and at two o'clock they called at another house on the
            same errand. They made excellent headway, for later in the
            afternoon they were seen near Mountain Lake, some seventeen miles
            from Madelia. The alarm had been flashed ahead over the wires,
            and squads were turning out from all points in hot pursuit.</p>

            Mountain Lake, from which points they started north, hoping to
            intercept the robbers. However, their efforts were futile, as it

            picketed their horses in a deep ravine, and deployed men on the
            row of high mounds commanding the prairie, and five miles down
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lost Timber”</span> valley. On arriving
            there, Dill's pickets were carried out three miles each way, and
            a watch kept for four hours. Scouts were sent down the valley,
            and and the pockets or ravines examined. At two p. m., no tidings
            being received, a council was held, and it was agreed that the
            robbers must have changed their route. Dill had been sanguine in
            regard to the Luverne route, and he, Church of Northfield, and I
            took a team for that point, leaving most of the party to push on
            to Pipestone, on the northern trail, knowing plenty of men could
            be started from Luverne. A ride of twenty tedious miles brought

            asked if they were sick. One said their horses had ran away and
            broke the wagon on the prairie, and they were forced to take to
            horse. He said he had got the rheumatism and his comrade had
            broken two ribs in falling from the wagon. This one gave evidence
            of a bad wound in the right side, and could scarcely sit up to
            eat breakfast. He refused tea and asked for milk. When they paid
            for their breakfast they did not unbutton their coats, but
            reached up under. It took a long time to mount, and they had to
            climb upon the fence and slide on to their horses. Both wore
            rubber coats, one torn on the right side, and one had fine boots
            with small heel and square toes. The boots were red from walking
            through the grass. They had bags filled with straw for saddles,
            and old ropes looped for stirrups. They moved slowly away
            southward. The robbers stopped at the house of Davis, in
            Springwater, and were given bread and butter. They staid fifteen

            Their course has been almost directly west by compass. I think
            they would have taken the northern trail, but were driven south
            by Dill's division in that direction. The fugitives were robbed
            of rest they intended to take, and were forced to make eighty
            miles without stopping, thus showing that they had good
            horses.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was the bitter
            ejaculation of pretty well every man who had for two long weeks
            persistently kept on the trail of the gang of desperadoes who
            perpetrated the Northfield outrage, and by Wednesday evening, the
            20th, the pursuers had for the most part returned to their homes
            with the full conviction that the chase was up, and the bandits
            had made good their escape. To some it was more than humiliating
            that after so many times being completely within their grasp, the
            scoundrels had succeeded in eluding them, and this too, so often
            through blundering and neglect. It seemed no consolation that the
            robbers had lost more in the State than they had ever done
            elsewhere. The two dead carcasses at Northfield, the captured
            horses, the wounded, fleeing men were impotent to assuage their
            disappointment and heal their wounded pride.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many exciting
            reports came from all quarters, but they were only met with
            incredulous laughter. The bandits were gone, and that was an end
            to the matter. People began to look upon the whole hunt as a huge
            joke, and admiration soon showed itself for the plucky six who
            could in the face of such fearful odds make good their escape.
            But there were those who still thought that at least four of the
            robbers were still in the neighborhood—the man wounded at
            Northfield, and the three who had not crossed the river, for
            notwithstanding the fact that J. Devans, of South Bend, said that
            he saw <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">five</span></em> men in South Bend, whom he
            was positive were the robbers, on the morning that the three
            crossed the bridge, no one gave credence to his tale.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This man
            asserted that he had occasion to get up about half-past two
            o'clock to get some water at the pump, his wife being sick, when
            he passed five men in the lane near South Bend Hotel. They wore
            long linen dusters with belts, and carried blankets done up in
            bridles, and he was positive they were the robbers. He saw them
            leave and go on to the railroad, two walking ahead, and the fifth
            man who was taller than the others, walking behind and seeming to
            stoop greatly and walk with difficulty, carrying one arm in a
            sling. Bob Younger's statement to the writer seemed to confirm
            Devan's story.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were not
            a few people in Mankato who believed that Jack O'Neil had a hand
            in the escape of the raiders. It will be remembered that this man
            figured conspicuously as an informant in a case spoken of at an
            early period of this narrative. Rumor had it that this O'Niel had
            still in his vicious den the wounded man concealed. To satisfy
            the public mind, a strong body of men crossed over the ferry and
            thoroughly searched O'Niel's premises in which were found,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span> besides the
            unfortunate female denizens, five as low looking vagabonds as
            were ever seen outside of prison walls. Although the search was
            fruitless, there are many people in Mankato who still think, now
            that the hunt is over, that the notorious Jack cleared his house
            of Ingalls, Peabody and Quane, because he expected the Northfield
            raiders on their return trip to stay and make use of his house.
            Many arrests were made of innocent persons in the eagerness to
            catch the robbers, and it was absolutely dangerous to be a large
            man of unusual appearance, especially to be alone in the woods or
            on country roads. There was one instance of a capture on
            suspicion which placed two horse thieves within the grasp of
            inexorable justice, that of the capture of the two men at St.
            Peter, who stayed at the old Wardlow place one night and rode off
            suspiciously at an early hour of the morning. These men who gave
            their names as John Chafer and George Ranks, proved to be two
            horse thieves from Iowa.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the hunt
            was at last given up in despair and people had gone back to their

            Thursday morning, September 21st, a Norwegian boy named Oscar O.
            Suborn, while out milking, saw two men pass his father's house.
            This boy lives eight miles from this place in a direction a
            little west of north, in Linden township, Brown county. In a few
            moments, he set down his pail and went to the house of Mads
            Ouren, and told what he had seen. Besides Mr. Ouren, there were
            there, Anton Anderson, Ole Stone and J. F. Devine. The latter
            said at once he believed it was the robbers, and that the people
            should be notified. Those there proceeded at once to do so. A
            gang were commencing to thresh nearby, so their horses and all
            others in the vicinity were ran off as fast as possible. The boy
            returned home and was there told that during his absence, the two
            other men had come to the house and called for something to eat.
            Said they were a fishing party, were in a hurry and could not
            stop for breakfast. The boy then jumped upon his father's horse
            and came full speed to this place with the news. When within a
            mile and a half of town, his horse fell down and threw him off
            into the mud, but he re-mounted and hastened on. Arriving here,
            the first he saw were Sheriff Glispin and T. L. Vought. The
            latter grasped his gun, mounted his horse and was off, closely
            followed by J. Severson. They were soon joined by Sheriff

            HAD SEEN THE ROBBERS</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and guided
            them to where the villains were. When the party came in sight of
            the robbers, the latter were at the house of John Sharphold.
            Seeing their pursuers coming they seemed to try to fortify behind
            a heap of earth, but when the party scattered out in an attempt
            to surround them, they made off. They waded in a slough near by,
            and when passing over a rise of ground beyond, Glispin and Will
            Estes fired at them with their rifles, just grazing the shoulder
            and cutting the shirt of one, as they afterwards learned.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This caused
            the miscreants to hasten their pace, and while those pursuing
            were crossing the slough and going cautiously up the hill
            (fearing an ambuscade,) they had made quite an advance. As they
            were on foot, it was now evident from the direction they were
            taking that they knew the country, and were making for
            Doolittle's herd. It was not long before they reached the Hanska
            slough which they waded, The party in pursuit, who were
            proceeding in a form of line, came to the slough and finding they
            could not cross, Glispin and Estes went down the slough and
            crossed at the house of A. Swingler, who showed them a cattle
            crossing. The Sheriff sent Severson to show those citizens
            coming, which way to proceed. Vought went up stream and crossed,
            and about this time was joined by Dr. Overholt, and coming down
            to the right of the robbers, fired occasionally to attract
            others. Dr. Overholt shot with his rifle and hit one of the
            robber's canes. Glispin and Estes coming up on the left, fired
            several shots, and the robbers returned the fire, and being at
            close range, the bullets flew thick about the pursuers, grazing
            Glispin's horse.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About half
            past 12 o'clock Will Estes ran out of ammunition and was obliged
            to come to town, informing those whom he met where to go, and as
            soon as he arrived here sent telegrams to St. James of
            movements.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            pursuit, Glispin, Vought and Overholt saw Doolittle's herd and
            bore to the right to prevent the robbers from capturing the
            horses, and crossed the river at J. Doolittle's; some men were
            ordered to stay there as guard.</p>

            FINDING THEMSELVES FOILED</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">the bandits
            went to the river opposite Andrew Andersen's house and called to
            him to bring over his horses, that they were after the robbers.
            He took the hint however and ran the horses off. The robbers then
            passed up the river to the next house and crossed at a ford; then
            passed through Anderson's cornfield to a granary, then seeing
            teams that Mr. Horace Thompson, President of the First National
            Bank of St. Paul, had out hunting, they started east toward them,
            but Mr. Thompson and his son put coarse shot in their guns and
            faced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span> them,
            seeing which the robbers turned north down the bluff and crept
            along in a band in the brush to the bank of the river.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sheriff
            Glispin, and others, came down to Andersen's house, and citizens
            arriving, the Sheriff posted pickets along the bluff on the south
            side of the river, to watch the robbers. Among these, August
            Fedder and Wm. Shannon were by the house, Ole Stone on the bluff,
            and G. W. Green on a point east of the picket line on the north
            side. At this time J. Dolittle came down and said the guards at
            his house had gone, and the Sheriff, T. L. Vought and Dr.
            Overholt returned there to see to it, and the latter was
            stationed there by the Sheriff.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile
            citizens were arriving on the north side of the river, and some
            of them saw the robbers go into the brush. About 1 o'clock Capt.
            W. W. Murphy arrived and having definitely ascertained where the
            villains were, and also that the citizens were unorganized, all
            willing but no one deciding what to do, he appeared to take in
            the situation immediately and at once took command and found
            every one well pleased to obey. After giving directions
            concerning the horses, he led forward to the north bank of the
            river, the stream being about 20 feet wide, and the prairie
            reaching to the water edge. Here he posted the men at equal
            distances, each with instructions how to act. The names of the
            men so posted were Geo. P. Johnston, T. Toren, W. H. Borland, C.
            Pittis. D. Campbell, Geo. Carpenter, Joe Crandall, H. Juveland,

            THE BANDITS DESCENDED THE BLUFF</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">into the
            brush, when they saw H. Thompson, and gave some necessary
            instructions there—the Sheriff being absent with T. L Vought at
            J. Doolittle's. Capt. Murphy after having a hurried consulation
            with. Ben Rice, put his horse in charge of Alba Crandall, who led
            several other horses, whom he posted on a slight knoll. Then he
            stepped to the edge of the bluff and called for volunteers to
            skirmish the brush, which is in a circular form and contains
            about 5 acres and is situated in the northeast quarter section
            20, township 107, range 31. This brush is willows and plumtrees,
            interspersed with vines. Ben Rice and Geo. Bradford immediately
            volunteered, followed by Chas. Pomeroy and James Severson. At
            this moment T. L. Vought arrived, who immediately dismounted and
            joined. Sheriff Glispin then came up and joined the party just as
            they were starting off. The Capt. gave the men orders to keep in
            line at an interval of 3 or 4 paces and in case the enemies were
            found, to rush upon them; to examine their <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span> guns carefully, and to
            shoot low. The line advanced as fast as possible into the brush
            and passed through to the river, then made a wheel to the left
            and passed up the river westward, with the right of the line near
            enough to see the water. After advancing in this direction about
            ten rods, a shot was fired from a very thick clump of willows, at
            a distance of fifteen feet from the right of the line. As the
            shot was fired, the robbers were seen obsecurely in a kneeling
            position, close together. Glispin returned the fire on the
            instant with a breech-loading carbine, and dropped to load. As
            four of the robbers commenced firing as fast as possible, they
            being armed with Colt's, and Smith and Wesson's six shooters,
            army size. Capt. Murphy opened fire at this close range with a
            Colt revolver; Rice discharged his carbine, then fired his
            pistol; Vought and Pomeroy fired with double-barreled shot guns,
            and Bradford and Severson with carbine and rifle. Just at this
            time Captain Murphy received a 44 calibre pistol shot, the ball
            striking a</p>

            the ball lodged in the lining of his vest. The blow raised a
            painful contusion on his side. Bradford also received a slight
            wound on the wrist, drawing blood. The bandits then retreated a
            little, firing as they did so, and being discovered by the men
            posted across the river on the north side, several shots were
            fired from there. Most of the charges in the skirmish line being
            exhausted, a slight cessation of firing took place, when the
            robbers cried out to cease firing, as they were all shot to
            pieces, the only one able to stand being Bob Younger, he held up
            his hand in token of surrender. He was immediately ordered to
            advance, several guns of the skirmishers being held on him till
            he was relieved of his belt and arms by Capt. Murphy, and assured
            of protection from further injury. Bob had received one wound in
            the breast; Cole and Jim Younger were completely riddled—Cole
            having received eleven and Jim five wounds—they were laying near
            together. Charley Pitts lay further to the right of the line,
            dead, having received five wounds, three of which would have
            caused death.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The robbers
            had two revolvers a piece, and some of them were ivory handled,
            nickle-plated, the finest ever seen in this part of the country,
            and their belts full of bullets.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After their

            crowds, composed of those engaged in the capture, and those met
            on the way down, the place where they were taken being about

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were kept
            under guard at the hotel. During their stay here they were seen
            by over three thousand persons, and their wounded appearance and
            pretenses of contrition drew forth a manifest sympathy from some,
            but this humane conduct of such has been very much
            exaggerated.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Saturday
            morning, Sheriff Glispin, with B. Rice and Captain Murphy as
            special deputies, started with the wounded bandits for Faribault,
            arrived in due time and delivered the prisoners to the Sheriff of
            Rice Co., that being the county in which their crime was
            committed. The dead robber was taken to St. Paul, by Geo. P.
            Johnston and G. W, Yates, and delivered to the State authorities
            for identification. Thus was the career of this band of notorious
            outlaws brought to an end for the present, with only two of the
            eight who came into the State escaped, and they wounded. They
            have raided in thirteen States, but Minnesota proved too much for
            them, and it is hoped this severe lesson will deter all others of
            the same stamp from attempting to rob, especially in this
            State.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His body was
            full of wounds, mostly caused by buckshot. His worst injuries
            were about the head, several shot having penetrated the skull and
            embedded themselves at the base of the brain. It was evident that
            some of these leaden missiles had lodged among the nerves of the
            right eye, as that organ was closed and inflamed, and appeared to
            be forced forward. On entering his head, these shot had broken
            down the palate arch, and the pain experienced by the prisoner
            must have been intense. Lying by his side was</p>

            side, and broken the roof of his mouth. His lips and cheeks were

            man has two wounds, one an old one, or rather of some days'
            standing, and supposed to be the result of Wheeler's carbine
            practice at Northfield, which caused the disarticulation of the
            right elbow joint. His other wound is from a ball entering the
            right side, just below the point of the scapula, tracing the
            sixth rib and coming out near the nipple. This is a mere flesh
            wound, and not at all dangerous.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first he
            seemed rather reluctant to talk much, and when asked his name, he
            said it was George Huddleston, to which the writer replied,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I know who you are,”</span> when he
            said, with a cheering smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, most
            people know me in St. Paul. I stayed at the Merchants, and was
            there when the Red Caps went to Winona to play the Clippers. I
            afterwards went over to Minneapolis and stopped at the Nicollet,
            but on my return to St. Paul, I registered at the
            European.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But by
            chatting familiarly with him, many facts of interest were
            elicited. He spoke of the Northfield escapade, and said it was
            the first of the kind he ever was in. When asked about his wound
            in the right arm, if it was not from the carbine of Wheeler, he
            stated that he thought it was from the pistol of Bates—he did not
            see Wheeler. His arm dropped on his leg as described, he said,
            which led to the belief that he was wounded in the leg.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In speaking of
            the dead men at Northfield, the writer said that there was some
            uncertainty whether the big man was Miller or Pitts. The prisoner
            promptly said, with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“It was not
            Miller.”</span></p>

            curiosity, when lo! presto! a metamorphose as sudden as it was

            had taken his advice, they would not have gone out to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span> Northfield.
            There was no means of getting away, for the roads were bad and
            the woods filled with lakes and sloughs. It would have been
            better for the band to have gone across the prairie from Mankato,
            for then they would have had some $30 each.</p>

            if he had tried to shoot any one, when he pointed out the fact
            that seven of the men were almost within hand's-reach of them,
            and asked what good would it have done him if all the seven were
            killed. There were men enough at long range with rifles to shoot
            him and his party down at their leisure.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Bob
            Younger was conversing with the writer, a poor woman came into
            the room, sobbing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Don't you know
            me?”</span> she said, addressing Bob.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“No, madame, I have not that pleasure,”</span> said
            Bob.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Don't you know me?”</span> reiterated the woman
            between her sobs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Indeed, I cannot recollect you, madame,”</span>
            replied Bob, gently.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Don't you remember the woman who gave you bread and
            butter?”</span> she asked.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Oh yes, certainly; and most thankful were we for

            "tei tei-q">“Oh, forgive me, sir,”</span> she sobbed,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“indeed, I did not intend to do
            it.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I have nothing to forgive,”</span> said Bob;
            <span class="tei tei-q">“you were very kind to us and we shall
            not forget it.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“But forgive me, sir,”</span> she persisted,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not mean to betray
            you.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Why, really, madam, we never supposed you did. We
            did not blame you at all. We are only very grateful for what you
            did for us.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bob,
            concerned, <span class="tei tei-q">“I hope you won't trouble
            about it, madam. It is nothing. We cast the die and lost, and do
            not blame you in the least. We are only very thankful for what
            you did.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“But forgive me,”</span> persisted the poor woman,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I am so sorry,”</span> and she began
            again to shed tears.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I have nothing to forgive, only to be grateful
            for,”</span> said Bub, <span class="tei tei-q">“but if it will
            make you feel better, I will say I forgive you,”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor woman
            seemed to be greatly relieved and left the room, when Bob turned
            round to the writer with a concerned and troubled look, and asked
            the woman's name.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Mrs. Suborn, the mother of the lad who informed the
            people of your whereabouts,”</span> was the reply.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“I shall never forget that name,”</span> said
            Bob.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cashier of
            the First National Bank of Mankato coming in asked Bob if he did
            not change a bill at his bank. Bob replied promptly that he did—a
            $50 bill, <span class="tei tei-q">“But”</span> said he,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“you were not in the bank at the time, we
            were, however, merely giving you a call, only a little
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span> matter
            prevented it, and we unfortunately went to Northfield
            instead.”</span> The cashier asked what their intentions were in
            Mankato. To which Bob replied that they intended to go through
            both banks—the City and First National, and he thought that it
            would have been a much safer job than the Northfield. No doubt
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“little circumstance”</span> he
            alluded to as destroying their plans was the fact of Jesse James
            being recognized by Robinson, as related elsewhere.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Friday evening
            at supper time, when the dining hall of the hotel was crowded, at
            one of the table, there were dark whispers and ominous</p>

            THREATS OF LYNCHING,</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and some talk,
            of several hundred people coming up from St. Paul and Northfield
            to carry out the disgraceful threat. This was sufficient to rouse
            the precautionary energy of Sheriff Glispin, who at once
            appointed an armed guard, which filled the entire hotel. The
            guard and the populace generally were determined to protect their
            prisoners to the bitter end, if the worst came to the worst, and
            at half past eight o'clock the hotel was cleared, but on the
            arrival of the 9 p. m. train, it was found that the rowdies had
            either missed the train, or had abandoned the scheme, or the
            whole thing, (which was most probable) was a hoax.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The talk at
            the supper table arose from a man recently from Mankato,
            asserting that the scoundrels should be lynched, offering to bet
            $500 that they would be strung up before morning. It was said
            that the man was intoxicated, but that was no palliation of his
            brutish threat.</p>

            DISPOSITION OF THE CAPTIVES.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
            news of the capture was received at St. Paul, Captain Macy,
            secretary to the Governor, telegraphed the executive, then at the
            Centennial, the fact. The Governor promptly responded, directing
            Capt. Macy to order the Madelia authorities to bring their
            prisoners, with the body of the dead bandit to this city. Capt.
            Macy spent about two hours in telegraphing with the sheriff of
            the county, who at first strongly opposed the removal, partly on
            the ground the wounded men were not in a condition to be moved,
            but principally from a fear that had somehow taken possession of
            the minds of those taking part in the capture, that their removal
            to St. Paul would invalidate their claim for the reward offered
            for their arrest. To this latter objection Capt. Macy answered
            that the Governor would be responsible for the preservation of
            all their rights, upon which the Sheriff telegraphed they would
            be sent down by the morning train, on a sleeper tendered for that
            purpose, by Supt. Lincoln. Later, however, the sheriff, in
            consultation with citizens, changed his mind, and determined to
            send his prisoners on to Faribault, the county seat of Rice
            county. Accordingly they were placed in the cars at Madelia on
            Saturday morning, and at every station en route a curious and
            eager mob awaited the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg
            63]</span> arrival of the train, anxious to get a glimpse of the
            notorious freebooters. At Mankato, half the city turned out, and
            arrangements were made at the depot for the crowd to pass through
            and feast their eyes upon the big show.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Faribault
            the crowd was comparatively small, owing, perhaps, to the fact
            that they were unexpectedly brought on by a freight train, but
            when it got generally noised about that the infamous desperadoes
            were lodged in the jail, people of all classes and both sexes
            thronged the building anxious to gain admittance.</p>

            AT ST. PAUL,</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Capt. Macy
            received a telegram from Sheriff Barton, of Rice county, as
            follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“I start for Madelia in half an
            hour. Will bring them by St. Paul.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saturday
            morning thereafter, about eleven o'clock crowds began to gather
            along the bluffs and on the bridge and in any position in which a
            view of the Sioux City train (on which it was supposed the
            robbers were being brought to the city) could be obtained. The
            train was seen crossing the river and immediately the crowd
            commenced swarming like a hive of bees. As the train approached,
            and when it came in front of the open space above the upper
            elevator, the rear platform of the cars appeared to be crowded
            with people, one man waving a roll of white paper. Then the
            excitement seemed to culminate. Crowds rushed down the streets in
            danger of being crushed under the wheels of buggies, wagons and
            vehicles of all descriptions, which dashed down the streets at a
            rate which set all ordinances at defiance, and scattered the mud
            around in a promiscuous manner. At reaching the levee a crowd of
            fully three thousand people in a terrible state of excitement,
            were assembled, some climbing up on the still moving train in
            spite of all efforts of the officers to prevent them, while
            others ran ahead of the engine and alongside. It soon became
            evident, however, that the prisoners were not aboard, and a rumor
            got afloat that they had been taken off the train at Chestnut
            street and brought to the county jail from thence.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then there was
            a scattering among the crowd, and a race was made for the jail,
            where the moving mass was equally disappointed. Here a large
            number of persons had already congregated and secured seats
            around the several entrances of the portico of the Court House,
            and everywhere where there was a chance of seeing anything.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here they
            waited patiently for a while, when some one started a story that
            the prisoners would be brought through the Fifth street entrance,
            and a run was made up Cedar street for that point. On arriving
            there they were assured that no prisoners had been brought into
            the jail through that entrance, and the idea began to creep
            through their brains that they had been badly sold. Some,
            however, could not be persuaded but that they would be smuggled
            into the building, when the crowd had dispersed, and after
            waiting for a considerable time <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page64">[pg 64]</span> longer, reluctantly coming to the
            conclusion that there was no chance for them to satisfy their
            curiosity with a sight of the desperadoes, slowly and reluctantly
            left the ground, and the square surrounding the jail was soon
            abandoned to its usual and casual passers by and occupants of the
            several offices.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dead man,
            Charley Pitts, was brought on to St. Paul and placed under the
            care of Dr. Murphy, Surgeon General of the State, for embalming.
            He was exhibited to an admiring throng of St. Paulites, who being
            disappointed in not having the big show of real live bandits,
            were obliged to content themselves with the dead one.</p>

            arrived in St. Paul on Saturday morning. These gentlemen came for
            the purpose of establishing the identity of the robbers. They
            were satisfied those killed at Northfield, were Bill Chadwell and
            Clell Miller, immediately recognizing their photographs.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Chief
            McDonough is a straight, fleshy gentleman, with a military
            bearing, a keen eye, and the appearance of a man possessed of the
            executive ability requisite to control and conduct so great a
            force of men, (over five hundred,) as compose the splendid police
            force of the city of St. Louis. He had obtained from Hobbs Kerry,
            one of the gang engaged in the bold raid on the train at
            Otterville, Mo., July 7th, detailed descriptions of the other
            members of the gang, and early yesterday morning he visited the
            capitol to view the body lying there. As soon as he looked upon
            it he recognized it as Charley Pitts, whose real name is George
            Wells. Every mark was found as detailed by the captured robber,
            and the chief was evidently pleased to find that he had succeeded
            in getting so much truth out of one of the members of a gang
            whose honor is pledged not to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“peach”</span> on their comrades. One of the most
            noticeable peculiarities of Pitts, who is a man of most powerful
            build, is his extremely short, thick feet. They require but
            number six boots, and look inadequate to support the ponderous
            form above. His hands, which are also small and fat, were
            roughened by work, and covered with black hair, exactly as Kerry
            had said. From Mr. McDonough, it was learned that Pitts is one of
            the men who are summoned when <span class="tei tei-q">“dirty
            work”</span> is on hand. His home is in Texas, and he is known as
            one of the boldest and most successful horse thieves in the
            country. His knowledge of horses is so great, that the care of
            the stock of the gang is always confided to him.</p>

            a special train was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">en route</span></em> had been kept so quiet,
            that on arriving at Faribault, no persons were at the depot
            except the officers of the road and Mr. Case, with several
            omnibuses. It had been arranged that only a select few should
            visit the jail with the detectives, and but eight persons,
            including the writer were admitted, the remainder of the party
            separating and seeking a lunch before they interviewed the
            outlaws.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            entire day there had been a constant stream of visitors from the
            adjacent country, who came in all sorts of conveyances, the
            citizens of Faribault giving way to them and awaiting a quieter
            time to call on their distinguished guests.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jail was
            surrounded by men and women when the chosen delegation arrived,
            but by an arrangement with Sheriff Barton, the crowd was
            restrained, and the St. Louis gentlemen, Mayor Maxfield, Chief
            King, Captain Macy, Dr. Murphy, Messrs. Lincoln and Merriam, and
            representatives of the St. Paul dailies were admitted.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On entering,
            Bob Younger was found sitting near the corner of the cage,
            quietly smoking a cigar with a newspaper on his lap. Cole was
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span> lying on a
            pallet at the end of the twenty foot jail outside the cage, with
            a cigar in his mouth and a daily paper before him. The lazy
            bandit was being fanned by a boy, and seemed wonderfully
            comfortable. The third man was lying on a cot just inside the
            bars, and was evidently suffering severely from the wound in his
            mouth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole Younger
            was found communicative as usual. Chief King, showed him pictures
            of the two James boys, taken eight years since, and he
            immediately knew them, but said nobody would recognize them from
            those pictures now. On looking at his own picture he acknowledged
            it as one of the best he ever had taken, but when he looked at
            that of Charley Pitts, he said he knew no man of that name. Chief
            King said: <span class="tei tei-q">“But you know this man as
            Wells,”</span> when Cole responded, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“There are Wellses in every part of the
            country.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time
            Mr. Ames, of Faribault, came up and asked what part he took in
            the affair at Northfield. He declined to tell. Mr. A. then said
            he thought he rode a white faced horse, and was the man that shot
            the Swede. Cole denied this. Ames said that man was observed as
            the best horseman of the crowd. Younger then said one man was as
            good a rider as another. He was raised on a saddle, his father
            having been a herder and stock man, and besides, he had served
            several years in the cavalry. The gentlemen then spoke of the
            killing of Heywood as a cowardly act. Cole said it was the result
            of impulse, as they did not intend to kill anybody. Their plan
            was to accomplish their ends by dash, and boldness, and to do the
            robbing while men were frightened. This was denied by the
            Northfield man, who claimed that they tried hard to kill Manning.
            Cole then said that they did not try to kill him, using his name
            as if he knew all about it, but fired all around him. Mr. Ames
            said that could not be true, as shots were found in the railing
            of the stairs behind which Manning stood. Younger denied this,
            and said they desired to kill no man, as it would be of no use to
            them. Ames then said he believed they had killed a hundred men,
            when Cole said he had no time to talk with such a man, he had
            been captured by brave men, and was being treated better than he
            deserved, that he did not fear death, but hoped to be prepared
            for a better world. He said he was tired and needed rest. At
            this, an impulsive gentleman standing by said he wished he would
            soon take his long rest. Cole seemed offended at this, and said
            it was <span class="tei tei-q">“of no”</span> use to talk to
            illiterate people, they could not</p>

            SUBLIME LIFE!”</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole said he
            did not ride his fine horse up here, but bought the one he rode
            of French, of St. Peter. When told by a visitor that they did bad
            shooting, he said if they would prop him up at the side of the
            road he would plug his hat with his left hand at ten rods every
            time. He said he was the man that took the pistols from the dead
            man at Northfield; and said he took his handkerchief out of his
            belt as he took it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg
            67]</span> off. He declined to tell the name of the dead man, as
            it was understood none should tell about another dead or
            alive.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Col Merriam
            sat by the side of Cole, and said, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Younger, I am not certain, but I think I have seen
            you before.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Where was
            this?”</span> said Cole. The Colonel said it was at Gad's Hill
            three years ago when the raid was made on the train. This, Cole
            denied, and said that at that time he was in St. Clair county, in
            Southwestern Missouri, where his uncle, Judge Younger resides. He
            said he would refer to his uncle, who is a judge, and was a
            member of the legislature, and also to a minister there. He
            further said that on the day of that raid he and his brother
            Robert were there, and that he preached in the afternoon,
            commencing at four o'clock.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Col. Merriam
            feels sure that Cole was there, judging from his figure, his
            hair, and particularly by his voice. Mr. Lincoln is also certain
            that he was one of the men on the train at that time, although he
            wore a cloth with eye holes over his face. Master Merriam, who
            was also on the train, is not certain, but thinks he has seen the
            villain.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bob Younger
            was asked if he was in the Gad's hill raid, but denied it, saying
            he was in Louisiana at that time, thus contradicting Cole. Bob
            says he is a novice, and has only been in a few scrapes.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While some of
            the visitors were talking with the boys, Mr. McDonough, his aid,
            and Dr. Murphy, were examining the prisoners for marks of
            identification, and no trouble was experienced in placing Cole
            and Bob Younger, but the identity of the one that claimed to be
            Jim, was doubted by the detectives, as James was badly wounded in
            the hip on the 7th of July last, and they thought he could not
            possibly be able to stand a campaign like this at present. They
            were of the opinion that he was Cal. Carter, a Texas desperado,
            and one that has seldom worked with a gang until lately.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every point of
            identification as given by Hobbs Kerry, was discovered on the
            Younger boys, even to the ragged wound on Bob's hand, where the
            thumb had been torn off and badly attended to.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Murphy
            said none were dangerously injured, and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“are sure to get well unless he doctors them.”</span>
            He made a careful examination and said they had only flesh
            wounds, and that the men could be about in a few days. None of
            the prisoners were shackled, and as the writer came out (he being
            the last one of the visitors), Cole Younger got up from his bed
            and walked across the jail as lively as he.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            robbers were captured their clothes and boots were found in a bad
            state. The three living robbers had each five dollars in their
            pockets, and the dead one had one dollar and a half. According to
            the statement of Bob Younger, all of the money, watches and
            jewelry they had was given to the two robbers that escaped, as
            they felt that their chances of getting away were much the
            best.</p>

            IMPRISONMENT AND TRIAL.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great fears
            were entertained that the Rice county jail at Faribault,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span> would not be
            of sufficient strength to hold the three famous bandit brothers,
            of whose great desperation and accomplishment in the art of
            prison breaking, the most wonderful and exaggerated stories were
            circulated throughout the State. Sheriff Ara Barton, however, did
            not hesitate to accept his distinguished boarders, and probably a
            thought of their escape from him never entered his mind. He had
            the bandits in his care, and he proceeded in the most systematic
            manner to provide for their remaining with him. No effort was
            made to strengthen the jail, but a series of guards was arranged
            so that the inside and outside were both constantly under the eye
            of watchful guards. The only fears entertained by those having
            the robbers in charge, were that there might be efforts made from
            the outside, either by a mob who would seek to lynch the
            brigands, or by their own friends, who would undertake to
            liberate them. For both cases, Sheriff Barton was prepared.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">was formed by
            citizens of the city, and the bell of an adjacent engine house
            was connected with the guard room of the jail by a wire. In case
            of any attack, these fifty men, armed with repeating rifles, were
            to rendezvous at a certain point from whence, under their
            captain, they would proceed in order to the jail. Another wise
            precaution taken by the Sheriff was in the locking of the doors
            of the jail, which are about 18 inches apart. He kept the key of
            the inner one himself, while the guard inside retained that of
            the outside door. At a private signal, the guard would reach
            through and unlock the outer one, when the Sheriff would find use
            for his key on the inner one. Several guards kept constant watch
            night and day around the jail, and at its entrance, a cannon
            loaded with a blank cartridge stood, ready to give a general
            alarm. As an instance of how perfect the arrangements were, it
            may be stated that on one occasion when the fire bell sounded, in
            less than three minutes the jail was surrounded by men, some
            carrying guns, some bludgeons, and some farm tools. Any party

            determined opposition, for the entire male population of
            Faribault were determined to support the Sheriff, and bring the
            murderers to trial.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notice of the
            arrangements about the prison were published, and all people were
            warned from approaching the jail in the night time, but one man,
            belonging to the police force of the city, thought he was so well
            known to the guards that he could safely visit them, and one
            evening he walked toward the prison. One of the guards challenged
            him, but instead of replying, he raised his hand to his coat, to
            make his silver star visible, and at the same moment, the guard
            mistaking the movement and supposing that the man was reaching to
            his breast pocket <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg
            69]</span> for a pistol, fired, inflicting a wound that proved
            fatal soon afterwards. Thus was another tragedy added to the
            list, and the horror of the affair was intensified.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus for a
            month everything moved quietly along about Governor Barton's
            hotel, and he remained unmoved by the hundreds of threats and
            propositions he received. He is a brave man made of stern stuff,
            and when a proposition was made to him to remain neutral while a

            the lynching, by Mayor Nutting, and people began to think it was
            best to abandon the project of anticipating the law, while the
            Younger boys remained in such hands. However, there is no doubt
            but that a summary disposal of these bloody cut-throats would
            have been widely endorsed by the best men of the State, as the
            feeling existed that no villians ever merited death more than
            they, while under the law of Minnesota, they could escape with a

            of medical care the Younger boys rapidly recovered from their
            wounds, and in less than two weeks, Cole and Jim were up and
            about, looking as well as ever, except that Cole had suffered a
            partial paralysis of the right eye, which had a wild, rolling
            look, and which was forced forward to an unpleasant prominence,
            caused by the buckshot that still remained in his head, and which
            he refused to allow the Doctors to remove, as he said they did
            not incommode him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jim's wounds
            on the outside of his face healed finely, and he proved to be a
            mild, pleasant and inoffensive fellow, appearing entirely
            incapable of such bloody work as that in which he had taken part,
            and strengthening the belief in the story that he had been
            prevailed upon contrary to his inclination. All of his back teeth
            had been carried away by the shot, and the roof of his mouth
            shattered, causing him much inconvenience in talking and eating,
            but his appetite was good, and he managed to do full justice to

            perfect general health, but the wound through the elbow of his
            right arm promised to incapacitate him, as it was rigidly stiff.
            The surgeons decided on a severe operation, and Bob carelessly
            submitted while the joint was broken and re-set. Then a
            hinge-like holder was placed around the wounded limb, and by
            slightly moving the joint each day, the arm was saved, and he is
            now able to make himself useful at light work in the State
            prison.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bandits
            occupied the jail with a number of other prisoners, and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span> were kept
            inside a series of strong iron bars that divided the cells from
            the corridor. Manacles were kept upon their legs, and the eye of
            a guard was never off them. They occupied their time in reading
            and writing, and Cole devoted himself almost constantly to
            reading the Bible, taking occasional instruction from the revised
            statutes of the State, relating the punishment of murderers. All
            were humble and patient, except that the independent Bob, when
            the subject of hanging was under discussion, would boldly claim

            IN COURT.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 7th day
            of November, the district court of Rice county convened in
            Faribault. Judge Sam'l Lord presiding. The first duty of the
            sheriff, was to present the names of twenty-two grand jurors,
            which he did on the 8th inst.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Younger
            brothers had engaged Mr. Thomas Rutledge, of Madelia, as their
            counsel, and had subsequently associated with him, Messrs.
            Batchelder and Buckham, of Faribault, two of the most eminent
            lawyers of the State. The prosecution was in the hands of George
            N. Baxter, Esq., the county attorney of Rice county, and he had
            woven a strong chain of evidence about the prisoners, having
            traced them and their comrades through all their journeying from
            the time they entered the State until the raid was made.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prisoners'
            counsel had long interviews with their clients, and it was
            generally understood that, in case they were indicted for murder
            in the first degree, they would plead <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“not guilty.”</span> This was taking a risk, as in
            case they were found guilty, the death penalty could be inflicted
            at the option of the jury, and it would have been difficult to
            find a jury but that would have quickly pronounced a doom so much
            in accordance with public sentiment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The county
            attorney, Mr. Baxter, drew and presented four indictments for the
            consideration of the grand jury, one charging them collectively
            with being accessory to the murder of Heywood, a second, charging
            them with attacking Bunker with intent to do great bodily injury;
            a third, charging them with robbing the bank at Northfield; and a
            fourth, charging Cole with the murder of the Swede, and his
            brothers as accessories.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Cole
            Younger read the last named indictment, he appeared greatly
            affected, and said that he had not expected such a bill, as he
            did not kill the Swede. He said it had probably been done by
            accident, as none of them shot to kill. From the time the
            indictments were read by Cole, he became low-spirited, and
            studied the statutes and consulted with his lawyers more than
            before. Bob kept up, and declared that he would not plead guilty
            in any case.</p>

            THE GRAND JURY</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">that had been
            summoned included twenty two of the best men in the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span> county, but the
            prisoner's counsel reduced it to seventeen, by challenging a
            number who had too freely expressed their ideas in regard to the
            affair. There is no doubt but that by continuing the same line of
            questioning the grand jury could have all been found wanting, but
            it was not the intention of the defense to delay the trial by
            reducing the number below the legal minimum, but simply to refer
            the bills to as few men as possible, feeling that the chance of
            their finding all of the indictments could be materially
            lessened.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It took the
            jury but a very short time after they commenced their work to
            find four true bills against the prisoners, and the evidence
            given by the witnesses that testified before them, was but a
            recapitulation of what they were entirely familiar with. In the
            case of the Swede, whom Cole Younger was charged with killing,
            evidence was given by a man and a woman, both of whom testified
            that they saw Cole shoot him coolly and deliberately.</p>

            IN THE COURT ROOM.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day
            after the court convened, the sister and an aunt of the Younger
            boys arrived in Faribault. The sister, Miss Henrietta Younger, is
            a very pretty, prepossessing young lady of about seventeen years,
            and she conducted herself so as to win the esteem of all who met
            her. Mrs. Fanny Twyman, their aunt, is the wife of a highly
            respectable physician practicing in Missouri, and appears to be a
            lady of the highest moral character. These ladies passed the
            greater portion of their time sitting with their relatives,
            behind the iron bars, reading, talking and sewing. On Thursday,
            the 9th of November, the grand jury signified that they had
            completed their labors as far as the cases of the Younger boys
            were concerned, and the sheriff was instructed to bring the
            prisoners to hear the indictments read.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This summons
            had been expected, and the boys were ready, dressed neatly, and
            looking wonderfully well after their unaccustomed confinement
            that had continued for more than a month. They quietly stood up
            in a row ready to be shackled together. Cole in the middle, Bob
            at the right, and Jim at the left. The shackles were placed on
            their feet; Bob being secured by one foot to Cole, and Jim by the
            other. When the handcuffs were placed on Cole, he remarked, that
            it was the first time he had ever worn them. The prisoners showed
            signs of nervousness, evidently fearing that the crowd outside
            would think it best to dispose of them without due process of
            law. However, nothing occurred except some almost inaudible
            mutterings among the spectators, but which were quickly quieted
            by right-minded citizens. Slowly the procession passed to the
            temple of justice, the prisoners seeing the sun and breathing the
            pure air for the first time in thirty days. In advance of them
            was an armed guard, led by the captain of the minute men, then
            came the sheriff by the side of his prisoners, the chief of
            police of Faribault, and his lieutenant, and finally another
            squad of minute men with their needle guns. On reaching the
            court-house, the guards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg
            72]</span> broke to the right and left, and allowed none to enter
            except those known to their captain.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cortege
            passed to the court room by a rear stairway, and when the
            prisoners arrived in front of the Judge, the court-room was
            thoroughly filled with people, all gazing with the greatest
            curiosity on the three</p>

            BLOODY BROTHERS.</h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shackles
            having been removed from the arms and legs of the prisoners, they
            were ordered to stand up while the indictment charging them with
            killing Heywood, was read to them by the county attorney. As
            their names were read, the Judge asked them if they were indicted
            by their true names, to which all responded in the affirmative.
            During the reading, Cole Younger never moved his sharp eye from
            the face of the attorney, in fact, his gaze was so intense, that
            Mr. Baxter appeared to feel it, and to be made somewhat nervous
            thereby. Bob did not appear to take great interest in the matter,
            and he gazed coolly about on the crowd.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sister and
            aunt of the boys were by their sides during this scene, and they
            walked with them as they returned to the jail under the same
            guard that escorted them forth. Until the following Saturday had
            been taken by the prisoners' counsel to plead to the indictment,
            and during the interval of three days the subject of how to plead
            was discussed for many hours. Bob was as independent as ever,
            declared he would not plead guilty, but the persuasions of sister
            and aunt finally prevailed, and when taken into court on Saturday
            in the same manner as before, each responded</p>

            Stillwater, at hard labor, for the term of his natural Life.
            After the dread words had been uttered, the sister broke down and
            fell sobbing and moaning on the breast of her brother Cole.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus these
            bloody bandits escaped the gallows where their many crimes should
            have been expiated, and in a few days from the time they were
            sentenced, they were on their way to Stillwater, under a strong
            guard, but no attempt was made to molest them, although large
            crowds were collected at each station on the railroads by which
            they traveled. Sheriff Barton knew well the citizens of his
            State, and he had no fear that he would be interfered with while
            discharging his duty. The bandits were accompanied to their final
            home in this world by their faithful relatives, who left them
            within the prison walls, taking away as mementoes the clothes
            which the wicked men had worn. The robbers were immediately set
            at work painting pails, a labor which called for no dangerous
            tools to prosecute, and a special guard was set upon the renowned
            villains, as it is not intended that they shall escape to again
            terrify the world by their wicked deeds.</p><a name="fig5" id=

          of the desperate raid, was born at Fitzwilliam, N. H., August 12th,
          1837. He left home when about twenty years of age, and passed the
          better part of a year in Concord, Mass., and then changed his
          residence to Fitchburg, remaining there not far from a year. At the
          age of twenty-three, or in 1860, he came as far west as New
          Baltimore, Mich., and for some twelve months was occupied as clerk
          and book-keeper in a drug store. Moline, Illinois, then became his
          home for a short time, but the war of the rebellion raging, he went
          to Chicago and enlisted for three years in the 127th Illinois
          regiment. This was in 1862. Soon after he was ordered to the front
          and saw not a little of hard service on the march, and on the field
          of battle. He was present at the unsuccessful attack on Vicksburg,
          and also at the capture of Arkansas Post. Not long after, his
          health giving way through exposure and over exertion, he was sent
          first to the hospital, and then sent, more dead than alive, to his
          friends in Illinois. A few months later, recovering his health
          sufficiently to do light service, he was detailed as druggist in a
          dispensary at Nashville, where he remained until the close of the
          war, and was discharged in May, 1865. The next year was spent, for
          the most part, with friends in Illinois, and then we find him, in
          the summer of 1866, in Minnesota, and in Faribault, and the year
          after in Minneapolis, in a drug store again. In the fall of 1867,
          he removed to Northfield to keep books in the lumber yard, for S.
          P. Stewart. Four years since he accepted the position in the bank
          which he held till all earthly occupations came to a sudden and

          the county. Possessing not only great physical strength and
          endurance, whereby I have seen him completely overcome, in several
          serious disturbances, larger men, boasting of their power and
          daring, but he has great magnetic and persuasive influence, and I
          have seen peace restored by his exceedingly quiet presence and
          determined glance, whereas only a few moments previously it looked
          threatening and dangerous. No tenderer or kinder-hearted man
          exists, unless duty compels otherwise. I know in doing business
          with him as an attorney and the evidence of the other lawyers will
          be the same, that in every respect he is honorable, fair, and
          impartial in the discharge of his duty, as well as a perfect
          gentleman. I always considered him a remarkable young man, all wire
          and grit. Four winters ago he was in Hon. B. Yates' store as a
          polite and obliging clerk. The next winter he went to work in a
          woolen mill at Minneapolis. He was in poor health; came to his home
          and was nominated on the Democratic ticket as a liberal, against
          the ex-sheriff, one of the most popular Republicans in the county,
          and Glispin carried by several hundred in a Republican stronghold.
          He served faithfully and well two years, and was re-nominated and
          re-elected again by a large majority, and is on the close of his
          second term, and I don't see any reason why he should not be a

          1861, and entered the service as Second Lieutenant, 14th

          points in the following sketch were furnished by the Younger boys
          and must be received as in a degree partial.—ED.]</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry W.
          Younger, the head of this branch of the Younger family was a native
          of Kentucky, but early in life he removed to Jackson county,
          Missouri, in company with his father's family. The family were
          thoroughly respectable, of more than ordinary intelligence, and
          comfortably provided with wealth. H. W. Younger proved to be a
          young man of superior ability, acquiring an excellent education,
          and occupying a prominent position in the political world. Ho
          served in the Missouri Legislature, and also as county judge in
          Jackson county. Col. Younger was married in 1830, and lived in
          Jackson county until 1858, during which time fourteen children,
          eight girls and six boys, were born to them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1858 the
          family moved to a larger farm near Harrisonville, Cass county,
          where his operations in farming, stock dealing and general trade
          became extensive, and his wealth rapidly increased. By his decided,
          and boldly maintained political convictions, he made many
          enemies—especially during the trouble which occurred between the
          people of his state and those of Kansas in regard to the admission
          of the latter as a slave state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the civil
          war broke out in 1861, Younger espoused the Union cause, and on
          account of his wealth and prominence was made the especial object
          of the lawless depredations of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jayhawkers”</span> of Kansas under Lane, Jemison and
          others. His property was destroyed, his stock stolen, and he with
          his family was obliged to flee for their lives.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in
          September 1862 as Col. Younger was driving into Harrisonville, with
          a large amount of money about him he was robbed and murdered in his
          buggy. Even after having disposed of the father, his enemies were
          not satisfied, and their aggressions were directed against the
          inoffensive widow and her family of young children. They were
          forced to burn and abandon their own home, and the poor woman found
          no peace until finally she died in Clay county, Missouri.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oldest son
          Richard had died in 1860 at the early age of 23, after having
          acquired a liberal education, and became an esteemed member of the
          Masonic order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the eight
          sisters six grew up, four being well married, one of the others
          dying within a few years, and another still living in maidenhood,
          being the one spoken of herein.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sons that
          lived to suffer from the aggressions of the enemies of <span class=

          Coleman, James Henry, John and Robert Ewing, three of whom are now
          in the hands of the law officers of Minnesota, and incarcerated in
          the prison at Stillwater.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No apology would
          be accepted by the public for the course which these men have

          Forgiveness was not found in these men. Revenge was the impulse
          that actuated them, and now they accept all mankind as foes. With
          their education and activity they might doubtless have become
          esteemed members of other communities, but they preferred to allow
          their resentment to lead them until they became outlaws and branded
          criminals. They have stated that they have deliberately chosen
          their profession, and are prepared to abide by the consequences.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This man whose
          name has become a terror throughout the entire west, was born
          January 15th, 1844, in Jackson county, Missouri. He was a bright,
          active lad, and somewhat wild. His education is not such as he
          might have acquired if he had availed himself of the advantages
          afforded him in his early youth. He was always full of daring, and
          was reckoned a keen young chap. He appears to have provoked the
          hatred of certain officers of the militia under Neugent at the
          early age of seventeen, and their persecutions, whether just or
          unjust, caused him to desert his home, even his plan of attending
          school at a distant place being interfered with.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in 1862
          Cole joined the famous Quantrell band of guerillas, with whom he
          remained until late in 1864, when he enlisted in the Confederate
          army. He became a captain, and remained in the service until the
          war ended, when he went to Mexico and California, where he stayed
          until 1866.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole now
          resolved to settle down and redeem the family farm, which had been
          sadly neglected. His enemies, however, would not permit him to work
          in peace, and he together with his brothers James and John were
          forced to go to Texas, where they intended to make a new home for
          their mother, but she died in 1870, before their plans were
          completed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1875,
          a preamble and resolution was introduced into the Missouri house of
          representatives, relating the crimes charged against the Younger
          brothers, and granting them full amnesty and pardon. It was,
          however, defeated by a small majority.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole Younger
          possesses talents of no ordinary degree, and his claim that he
          could never live a reputable life is absurd, as he could have
          established himself in a distant community or in a foreign land and
          prospered, if he had so desired. This is proved in the case of his
          brother James, who, when the Northfield raid was planned, was
          living and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span>
          prospering in California, where he had accumulated quite a sum of
          money and was in a fair way of becoming well off. Money was needed
          for the enterprise, and after frequent solicitation he was induced
          to return to his old life and embark his savings in the speculation
          that has proved so terribly disastrous, and has consigned him to a
          living tomb.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole appears to
          have early cultivated a taste for the wildest of adventures, and
          with a ferocity and cruelly almost fiendish, the taking of human
          life, when it interfered with his plans appears to have been no
          more to him than the use of hard words among ordinary men. During
          his connection with the Quantrell gang he was the boldest and
          bloodiest of the outlaws, and was guilty of many terrible deeds
          when his passions got the better of his judgment, while at other
          times he would treat his defeated antagonists with a magnanimity
          which showed that there was really a heart hidden away somewhere
          about him. At times he would spare none of his enemies, shooting
          them down like dogs, even when wounded and unable to defend
          themselves, and at other times he would himself nurse and comfort
          his most hated foe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His statement
          that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">never killed a man</span></em> except in
          legitimate conflict, is of course absurd, and none will believe
          that a man who has had so desperate an experience as Cole Younger
          can place any high value upon human life. At horse races, in
          gambling hells, on the prairies, in railroad trains, and in quiet
          valleys, he has pursued his nefarious profession, and satisfied his
          revenge or gained money by force of arms, intimidating and killing
          those who came in his way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is told that
          at a certain horse race he had wagered money on his horse, but one
          of the crowd, all of whom were enemies of Cole, by a cowardly trick
          caused his horse to lose. He forbade the stake-holder to deliver
          the money to his opponent, and when he insisted upon doing so Cole
          drew two large pistols and as he dashed away he discharged them
          into the crowd killing three men, and escaping unharmed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exploits of
          Quantrell and his men have been so often published that it is not
          necessary to rehearse them at this time, but in nearly all of the
          most desperate and bloody encounters of the desperate gang Cole
          Younger played a prominent part. He was appointed to lead the most
          dangerous expeditions, and his success was such that it appeared as
          if the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">devil himself were at his
          elbow</span></em>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
          sad and cruel murders that Younger was forced to commit, was when,
          after a visit to his grandmother, he was met on the threshold by
          his cousin, Captain Charles Younger, who belonged to the militia of
          the state. The cousins shook hands, after which Captain Younger
          informed his relative that he was his prisoner. Instantly Cole drew
          his revolver, and placing it in front of his cousin's face fired,
          killing him instantly. Although the vicinity was filled with
          militiamen the guerilla made good his escape with his usual

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is related
          that at one time Quantrell's company, after an encounter
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span> with a party of
          jayhawkers, found fifteen prisoners on their hands. As was the
          custom, arrangements were speedily made to put them to death. Among
          the arms captured was an Enfield rifle, and as none of the
          guerillas had ever seen one before, it was decided to test its
          merits, as they had heard that its force was terrible. The poor
          prisoners were placed in a row one behind the other, and Cole
          Younger, claiming that the weapon ought to kill ten men at a shot,
          deliberately fired at fifteen paces. The rifle disappointed the
          bloody executioner, as it killed but the first three men. Seven
          shots were fired by the cruel marksman before the fifteen were
          disposed of.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 144%">AS A FOOT-PAD AND ROBBER</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole Younger is
        charged with having been connected with a great number of wild
        adventures where stages, railroad trains, banks and stores have been
        robbed, and his connection with them is not doubted by many, although
        he has proved by respectable parties that he had nothing to do with
        some of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A series of
        desperate crimes commenced to be committed as early as 1868, and it
        was evident that a regularly organized band existed. It was, and is,
        believed that the Younger brothers and the James brothers were the
        leading spirits of the organization, and that it consisted of
        desperate characters living in all parts of the western states as far
        south as Texas and north through the territories. In 1868 a bank was
        robbed in Russellville, Ky., and a good haul was made. In the same
        year the bank at Gallaten, Mo., was attacked, and the cashier, J. W.
        Sheets, was killed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August, 1873,
        the safe belonging to Wells, Fargo &amp; Co's express company was
        taken from a stage in Nevada territory, by four masked brigands, and
        broken open and robbed of about $12,000 in gold and greenbacks, while
        the driver and passengers were prevented from interfering by cocked
        guns held at their heads.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January, 1874,
        a stage en route for the Arkansas Hot Springs, was stopped at Gain's
        place by five men wearing army overcoats, and all of the passengers
        were forced to give up all of their money and valuables. There were a
        number of gold watches taken, the robbers declining to receive any
        silver ones, and the sums of money received ranged from $5 to $650.
        The robbers asked if any of the passengers had been in the
        Confederate army, and when one responded in the affirmative, his
        property was returned to him, with the remark that they only robbed
        Northern men, who had driven them into outlawry. Another man who was
        entirely crippled by rheumatism was not interfered with and was not
        robbed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In February, 1874,
        the First National Bank of Quincy, Illinois, was robbed of over
        $500,000 in money and bonds, but as the work was done in the night,
        it is thought that the Younger gang was not concerned in it, as they
        have never been known as burglars, but bold, daring highwaymen, who
        work openly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thought
        there can be no doubt but that the Youngers were <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span> among the gang that attacked
        the train at Gad's Hill, in 1873, as it was one of the boldest
        robberies on record, the passengers in an entire train being
        intimidated and robbed by a few men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole Younger was
        one of the principal actors in the Northfield tragedy, leading the
        squad which dashed through the streets to intimidate the inhabitants
        while his comrades robbed the bank. Undoubtedly he is accused of many
        crimes he never committed, but he has made himself a name that will
        long exist, as one of the most bold and reckless outlaws of modern
        times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He claims that he
        is now for the first time in prison, and one cannot but wonder how,
        in this age of intelligence and civilization, so terrible a
        freebooter could have carried on his nefarious business for fourteen
        long years almost unmolested.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next brother,
        James H. Younger, is now about 29 years of age, and is one of the
        captives now in the State prison. He has suffered greatly from his
        wounds received at the time of his capture. He is a mild, inoffensive
        looking man, and would not be taken for a robber and murderer. He has
        always been the pet of the family, and after the fight at Madelia
        which closed his career as a bandit, his brothers Cole and Bob showed
        great anxiety about him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cole said he did
        not fear death as it would be over in five minutes, but he entreated
        the attending doctor to <span class="tei tei-q">“exercise his utmost
        skill on Jim, who was always a good boy.”</span> Bob also asked
        several times for Jim, displaying much concern for his welfare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When their young
        sister, Miss Ret Younger, visited them in their prison on the 3d of
        October, 1876, she was terribly excited in finding James in such a
        plight, and gave way to sobs and shrieks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">James joined
        Quantrell's company in 1863, but in the autumn of 1864 he was taken
        prisoner in the skirmish which resulted in the death of the notorious
        leader, and was incarcerated in the military prison at Alton, Ill.,
        where he remained until the middle of 1866. He has been more domestic
        in his tastes than his brothers, although he has been in many
        desperate scrapes, and when the Northfield robbery was planned he was
        living in California as stated elsewhere.</p>

        especially in his captivity. His career of crime extends over about
        three years, commencing when he was charged with horse stealing in
        connection with his brother John. Until that time he had remained
        quietly at home, being the only protector his mother had until her
        death, and his sister since. Bob was one of the men in the bank at
        Northfield and was to have taken the money.</p>

        possessed a great knowledge of horses. His nature was brutal, and he
        was as bold and tenacious as a bull dog. The gang always engaged him
        when particularly dirty work was on hand, and when on a long tramp,
        as his horse education made him valuable in the care of stock. His
        body has been embalmed and is now in the possession of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is supposed
        that the two robbers that succeeded in escaping, leaving six of the
        gang in Minnesota, three captives and three dead, were the notorious
        James boys, Frank and Jesse. These bandits claim, as do the Younger
        brothers, that they were forced to a course of crime by the
        aggressions of their enemies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the close of
        the war down to the present time these men have been outlaws, and a
        long list of crimes are laid at their door. Among others may be named
        the robbing of the bank at Russellville, Ky., in March, 1868. The
        attack on the bank of Gallaten, Mo., and the kilting of the cashier,
        J. W. Sheets, in December of the same year. Another bank robbery at
        Corydon, Iowa, in June, 1871. Another in Columbia, Ky., when the
        cashier was killed, and still another robbery of the bank of St.
        Genevieve, Mo., May, 1873. The attack on the railroad train at Gad's
        Hill in 1873, the more recent robbery, in December, 1875, of the
        express company's safe on a train on the Kansas Pacific Railroad at
        Muncie, where $30,000 was secured, and the Otterville robbery on the
        Missouri Pacific Railroad last July. All are laid to this wonderful
        gang of bandits which includes the James and Younger boys and a
        working gang of perhaps fifteen others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January, 1875,
        a desperate attempt was made to capture the James brothers by
        Pinkerton's detective police, by surrounding and firing the house in
        which their mother, now the wife of Dr. Samuels of Clay county, Mo.,
        lived. It was a sad failure, one person being killed and several
        wounded. There are no good likenessess of these robbers extant, the
        only ones the police have being eight years old, and Cole Younger
        says they look nothing like them.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a meeting of
        the banks and bankers of St. Paul, Minn., Sept. 19th 1876, the
        following gentlemen, Henry P. Upham, Walter Mann, and John S. Prince
        were appointed a committee to issue a circular appeal to the banks
        and bankers in the United States and Canada, requesting voluntary
        contributions in aid of the family of Joseph Lee Heywood, late acting
        Cashier of the first national bank of Northfield, Minn., who was
        instantly killed by a pistol shot by one of the gang of Younger-James
        Bros., desperadoes. In answer to about seven thousand circulars that
        were sent out, the committee received Twelve Thousand Six Hundred and
        Two Dollars and Six Cents($12,6022.06), which, with the Five Thousand
        Dollars donated by the First National Bank of Northfield to Mrs.
        Heywood and her child, made the sum of Seventeen Thousand Six Hundred
        and Two Dollars and Six Cents, ($17,602.06), a handsome tribute to
        the brave and noble cashier, who sacrificed his life rather than
        betray his trust.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is estimated

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways

              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the

              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
